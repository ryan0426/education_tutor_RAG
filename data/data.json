    "document": "C++ Introduction What is C++? C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23. Why Use C++ C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++ is fun and easy to learn! As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa. Difference between C and C++ C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax. The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not. Get Started This tutorial will teach you the basics of C++. When you are finished with this tutorial, you will be able to write C++ programs and create real-life examples. It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience."

    "document": "C++ Getting Started C++ Get Started To start using C++, you need two things: There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below). C++ Install IDE An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code. Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code. Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited. We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start. You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler. mingw-setup.exe C++ Quickstart Let's create our first C++ file. Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File. Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as): myfirstprogram.cpp Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code. In Codeblocks, it should look like this: Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this: Hello World!Process returned 0 (0x0) execution time : 0.011 sPress any key to continue. Congratulations! You have now written and executed your first C++ program. Learning C++ At W3Schools When learning C++ at W3Schools.com, you can use our \"Try it Yourself\" tool, which shows both the code and the result. This will make it easier for you to understand every part as we move forward: myfirstprogram.cpp Code: Result: Hello World!"

Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local: Example A variable created outside of a function is global and can therefore be used by anyone: // Global variable xint x = 5;void myFunction() { // We can use x here cout << x << \"\\n\";}int main() { myFunction(); // We can also use x here cout << x; return 0;} Try it Yourself » Naming Variables If you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function, C++ will treat them as two separate variables; One available in the global scope (outside the function) and one available in the local scope (inside the function): Example The function will print the local x, and then the code will print the global x: // Global variable xint x = 5;void myFunction() { // Local variable with the same name as the global variable (x) int x = 22; cout << x << \"\\n\"; // Refers to the local variable x}int main() { myFunction(); cout << x; // Refers to the global variable x return 0;} Try it Yourself » However, you should avoid using the same variable name for both globally and locally variables as it can lead to errors and confusion. In general, you should be careful with global variables, since they can be accessed and modified from any function: Example Change the value of x from myFunction: // Global variable xint x = 5;void myFunction() { cout << ++x << \"\\n\"; // Increment the value of x by 1 and print it}int main() { myFunction(); cout << x; // Print the global variable x return 0;}// The value of x is now 6 (no longer 5) Try it Yourself » Conclusion To sum up, use local variables (with good variable names) as much as you can. This will make your code easier to maintain and better to understand. However, you may find global variables when working on existing C++ programs or while collaborating with others.

This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve. Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it. Recursion Example Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers: Example Example Explained When the sum() function is called, it adds parameter k to the sum of all numbers smaller than k and returns the result. When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When running, the program follows these steps: sum() k k Since the function does not call itself when k is 0, the program stops there and returns the result. k The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming."

When an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an exception (throw an error). C++ try and catch Exception handling in C++ consist of three keywords: try, throw and catch: try throw catch The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. try The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error. throw The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. catch The try and catch keywords come in pairs: try catch Example Consider the following example: Example We use the try block to test some code: If the age variable is less than 18, we will throw an exception, and handle it in our catch block. try age 18 throw catch In the catch block, we catch the error and do something about it. The catch statement takes a parameter: in our example we use an int variable (myNum) (because we are throwing an exception of int type in the try block (age)), to output the value of age. catch catch int myNum int try age age If no error occurs (e.g. if age is 20 instead of 15, meaning it will be be greater than 18), the catch block is skipped: age 20 15 catch Example You can also use the throw keyword to output a reference number, like a custom error number/code for organizing purposes (505 in our example): throw 505 Example Handle Any Type of Exceptions (...)

Datetime structures are structures that represent different components of the date and time as members. This makes it easier for us to specify dates.

For example, you can access the first or the last element of a vector with the .front() and .back() functions: .front() .back() Example To access an element at a specified index, you can use the .at() function and specify the index number: .at() Example Note: The .at() function is often preferred over square brackets [] because it lets you know if an error occurs. .at() [] For example if the element is out of range: Example Change a Vector Element To change the value of a specific element, you can refer to the index number: Example However, it is safer to use the .at() function: .at() Example Add Vector Elements The biggest difference between a vector and an array is that vectors can grow dynamically. That means you can add or remove elements from the vector. To add an element to the vector, you can use the .push_back() function, which will add an element at the end of the vector: .push_back() Example You can add as many elements as you want: Example Remove Vector Elements To remove an element from the vector, you can use the .pop_back() function, which removes an element from the end of the vector: .pop_back() Example Note: Elements are usually only added and removed from the end of the vector. If you need to add or remove elements from both ends, it is often better to use a deque instead of a vector. Vector Size To find out how many elements a vector has, use the .size() function: .size() Example Check if a Vector is Empty There is also a function to find out whether a vector is empty or not."

    "document": "C++ Iterator C++ Iterators Iterators are used to access and iterate through elements of data structures (vectors, sets, etc. ), by \"pointing\" to them. It is called an \"iterator\" because \"iterating\" is the technical term for looping. To iterate through a vector, look at the following example: Example it for it cars.begin() it cars.end() ++it *it Note: The type of the iterator must match the type of the data structure it should iterate through (string in our example) string What is begin() and end()? begin() end() begin() and end() are functions that belong to data structures, such as vectors and lists. They do not belong to the iterator itself. Instead, they are used with iterators to access and iterate through the elements of these data structures. begin() end() begin() end() To understand how they work, let's continue to use vectors as an example: Begin Examples begin() points to the first element in the vector (index 0, which is \"Volvo\"): begin() Example To point to the second element (BMW), you can write cars.begin() + 1: cars.begin() + 1 Example And of course, that also means you can point to the third element with cars.begin() + 2: cars.begin() + 2 Example End Example end() points to one position after the last element in the vector (meaning it doesn't point to an actual element, but rather indicates that this is the end of the vector). end() So, to use end() to point to the last element in the cars vector (Mazda), you can use cars.end() - 1: end() cars.end() - 1 Example Why do we say \"point\"? Iterators are like \"pointers\" in that they \"point\" to elements in a data structure rather than returning values from them. They refer to a specific position, providing a way to access and modify the value when needed, without making a copy of it. For example: Example The auto Keyword auto In C++ 11 and later versions, you can use the auto keyword instead of explicitly declaring and specifying the type of the iterator. auto The auto keyword allows the compiler to automatically determine the correct data type, which simplifies the code and makes it more readable: auto Instead of this: You can simply write this: In the example above, the compiler knows the type of it based on the return type of cars.begin(), which is vector<string>::iterator. it cars.begin() vector<string>::iterator The auto keyword works in for loops as well: auto for For-Each Loop vs. Iterators You can use a for-each loop to just loop through elements of a data structure, like this: Example When you are just reading the elements, and don't need to modify them, the for-each loop is much simpler and cleaner than iterators."

Algorithms Another important feature of iterators is that they are used with different algorithm functions, such as sort() and find() (found in the <algorithm> library), to sort and search for elements in a data structure. sort() find() <algorithm> For example, the sort() function takes iterators (typically returned by begin() and end()) as parameters to sort elements in a data structure from the beginning to the end. sort() begin() end() In this example, the elements are sorted alphabetically since they are strings: Example And in this example, the elements are sorted numerically since they are integers: Example To reverse the order, you can use rbegin() and rend() instead of begin() and end(): rbegin() rend() begin() end() Example"

    "document": "CSS Introduction CSS is the language we use to style a Web page. What is CSS? CSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple Styles! Here we will show one HTML page displayed with four different stylesheets. Click on the \"Stylesheet 1\", \"Stylesheet 2\", \"Stylesheet 3\", \"Stylesheet 4\" links below to see the different styles: Why Use CSS? CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. CSS Example CSS Solved a Big Problem HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like: <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page! If you don't know what HTML is, we suggest that you read our HTML Tutorial. CSS Saves a Lot of Work! The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files. With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Video: CSS Introduction"

    "document": "CSS Syntax A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. CSS Syntax  The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. Example In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color: p color red text-align center You will learn much more about CSS selectors and CSS properties in the next chapters! Video: CSS Syntax"

  {
    "document": "CSS Selectors A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style. CSS Selectors CSS selectors are used to \"find\" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. We can divide CSS selectors into five categories: This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors. The CSS element Selector The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name. Example Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: The CSS id Selector The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. Example The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id=\"para1\": Note: An id name cannot start with a number! The CSS class Selector The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. Example In this example all HTML elements with class=\"center\" will be red and center-aligned: You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. Example In this example only <p> elements with class=\"center\" will be red and center-aligned: HTML elements can also refer to more than one class. Example In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class=\"center\" and to class=\"large\": Note: A class name cannot start with a number! The CSS Universal Selector The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page. Example The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: The CSS Grouping Selector The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions. Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions): It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code. To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma. Example In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: All CSS Simple Selectors Video: CSS Simple Selectors"

    "document": "How To Add CSS When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet. Three Ways to Insert CSS There are three ways of inserting a style sheet: External CSS With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section. Example External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page: An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension. The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags. Here is how the \"mystyle.css\" file looks: \"mystyle.css\" Note: Do not add a space between the property value (20) and the unit (px): Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px; Correct (no space): margin-left: 20px; margin-left: 20 px; margin-left: 20px; Internal CSS An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section. Example Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page: Inline CSS An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property. Example Inline styles are defined within the \"style\" attribute of the relevant element: Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly. Multiple Style Sheets If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. Assume that an external style sheet has the following style for the <h1> element: Then, assume that an internal style sheet also has the following style for the <h1> element: Example If the internal style is defined after the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be \"orange\": Example However, if the internal style is defined before the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be \"navy\": Cascading Order What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element? All the styles in a page will \"cascade\" into a new \"virtual\" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority: So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

RGB Value In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue) Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255. For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0. To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0). To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255). Experiment by mixing the RGB values below:  RED GREEN BLUE Example Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources: Example RGBA Value RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00). To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.

The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each component. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.

Example Lightness The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) and 100% means full lightness (white).

This is often an undesirable result. Example Here, the <div> element is given a width of 300px. However, the actual width of the <div> element will be 350px (300px + 25px of left padding + 25px of right padding): To keep the width at 300px, no matter the amount of padding, you can use the box-sizing property. This causes the element to maintain its actual width; if you increase the padding, the available content space will decrease. box-sizing Example Use the box-sizing property to keep the width at 300px, no matter the amount of padding: More Examples Set the left padding This example demonstrates how to set the left padding of a <p> element.

    "document": "CSS Box Model All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The CSS Box Model In CSS, the term \"box model\" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins. The image below illustrates the box model: Explanation of the different parts: The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. Example Demonstration of the box model: Width and Height of an Element In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works. Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the total width and height of an element, you must also include the padding and borders. Example This <div> element will have a total width of 350px and a total height of 80px: Here is the calculation: 320px (width of content area) + 20px (left padding + right padding) + 10px (left border + right border) = 350px (total width) 50px (height of content area) + 20px (top padding + bottom padding) + 10px (top border + bottom border) = 80px (total height) The total width of an element should be calculated like this: Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border The total height of an element should be calculated like this: Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border Note: The margin property also affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but the margin is not included in the actual size of the box.

However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs. Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> - <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs. The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size. Absolute size: Relative size: Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em). Set Font Size With Pixels Setting the text size with pixels gives you full control over the text size: Example Tip: If you use pixels, you can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page. Set Font Size With Em To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels. 1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px. The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em Example In the example above, the text size in em is the same as the previous example in pixels. However, with the em size, it is possible to adjust the text size in all browsers.Unfortunately, there is still a problem with older versions of Internet Explorer. The text becomes larger than it should when made larger, and smaller than it should when made smaller. Use a Combination of Percent and Em The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element: Example body { font-size: 100%;} h1 { font-size: 2.5em;} h2 { font-size: 1.875em;} p { font-size: 0.875em;} Try it Yourself » Our code now works great!

    "document": "CSS Google Fonts Google Fonts If you do not want to use any of the standard fonts in HTML, you can use Google Fonts. Google Fonts are free to use, and have more than 1000 fonts to choose from. How To Use Google Fonts Just add a special style sheet link in the <head> section and then refer to the font in the CSS. Example Here, we want to use a font named \"Sofia\" from Google Fonts: Result: Sofia Font Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. 123456790 Example Here, we want to use a font named \"Trirong\" from Google Fonts: Result: Trirong Font Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. 123456790 Example Here, we want to use a font named \"Audiowide\" from Google Fonts: Result: Audiowide Font Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. 123456790 Note: When specifying a font in CSS, always list at minimum one fallback font (to avoid unexpected behaviors). So, also here you should add a generic font family (like serif or sans-serif) to the end of the list. For a list of all available Google Fonts, visit our How To - Google Fonts Tutorial. Use Multiple Google Fonts To use multiple Google fonts, just separate the font names with a pipe character (|), like this: | Example Request multiple fonts: Result: Audiowide Font Sofia Font Trirong Font Note: Requesting multiple fonts may slow down your web pages! So be careful about that. Styling Google Fonts Of course you can style Google Fonts as you like, with CSS! Example Style the \"Sofia\" font: Result: Sofia Font Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. 123456790 Enabling Font Effects Google has also enabled different font effects that you can use. First add effect=effectname to the Google API, then add a special class name to the element that is going to use the special effect. The class name always starts with font-effect- and ends with the effectname. effect=effectname font-effect- effectname Example Add the fire effect to the \"Sofia\" font: Result: Sofia on Fire To request multiple font effects, just separate the effect names with a pipe character (|), like this: | Example Add multiple effects to the \"Sofia\" font: Result: Neon Effect Outline Effect Emboss Effect Multiple Shadow Effect"

    "document": "CSS Great Font Pairings Great font pairings are essential to great design. Font Pairing Rules Here are some basic rules to create great font pairings: 1. Complement It is always safe to find font pairings that complement one another. A great font combination should harmonize, without being too similar or too different. 2. Use Font Superfamilies A font superfamily is a set of fonts designed to work well together. So, using different fonts within the same superfamily is safe. For example, the Lucida superfamily contains the following fonts: Lucida Sans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif and Lucida Math. 3. Contrast is King Two fonts that are too similar will often conflict. However, contrasts, done the right way, brings out the best in each font. Example: Combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination. A strong superfamily includes both serif and sans serif variations of the same font (e.g. Lucida and Lucida Sans). 4. Choose Only One Boss One font should be the boss. This establishes a hierarchy for the fonts on your page. This can be achieved by varying the size, weight and color. Example No doubt \"Georgia\" is the boss here: Below, we have shown some popular font pairings that will suit many brands and contexts. Georgia and Verdana Georgia and Verdana is a classic combination. It also sticks to the web safe font standards: Example Use the \"Georgia\" font for headings, and \"Verdana\" for text: Beautiful Norway Norway has a total area of 385,252 square kilometers and a population of 5,438,657 (December 2020). Norway is bordered by Sweden, Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak to the south, with Denmark on the other side. Norway has beautiful mountains, glaciers and stunning fjords. Oslo, the capital, is a city of green spaces and museums. Bergen, with colorful wooden houses, is the starting point for cruises to the dramatic Sognefjord. Norway is also known for fishing, hiking and skiing. Helvetica and Garamond Helvetica and Garamond is another classic combination that uses web safe fonts: Example Use the \"Helvetica\" font for headings, and \"Garamond\" for text: Beautiful Norway Norway has a total area of 385,252 square kilometers and a population of 5,438,657 (December 2020).

The default display value for most elements is block or inline. block inline The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements. display Block-level Elements A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Examples of block-level elements: Inline Elements An inline element DOES NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value. position position: static; HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page: position: static; Here is the CSS that is used: Example position: relative; An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. position: relative; Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. Here is the CSS that is used: Example position: fixed; An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. position: fixed; A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used: Example position: fixed; position: absolute; An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). position: absolute; However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements. Here is a simple example: Here is the CSS that is used: Example position: sticky; An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. position: sticky; A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it \"sticks\" in place (like position:fixed). relative fixed Note: You must specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work. top right bottom left In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position. top: 0 Example Positioning Text In an Image How to position text over an image: Example Try it Yourself: More Examples Set the shape of an element This example demonstrates how to set the shape of an element."

You can easily create three floating boxes side by side. However, when you add something that enlarges the width of each box (e.g. padding or borders), the box will break. The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in the box's total width (and height), making sure that the padding stays inside of the box and that it does not break. box-sizing You can read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing Chapter. Images Side By Side The grid of boxes can also be used to display images side by side: Example Equal Height Boxes In the previous example, you learned how to float boxes side by side with an equal width. However, it is not easy to create floating boxes with equal heights. A quick fix however, is to set a fixed height, like in the example below: Box 1 Some content, some content, some content Box 2 Some content, some content, some content Some content, some content, some content Some content, some content, some content Example However, this is not very flexible. It is ok if you can guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in them. But many times, the content is not the same. If you try the example above on a mobile phone, you will see that the second box's content will be displayed outside of the box. This is where CSS3 Flexbox comes in handy - as it can automatically stretch boxes to be as long as the longest box: Example Using Flexbox to create flexible boxes: Tip: You can read more about the Flexbox Layout Module in our CSS Flexbox Chapter.

To work with CSS counters we will use the following properties: counter-reset counter-increment content counter() counters() To use a CSS counter, it must first be created with counter-reset. counter-reset The following example creates a counter for the page (in the body selector), then increments the counter value for each <h2> element and adds \"Section <value of the counter>:\" to the beginning of each <h2> element: Example Nesting Counters The following example creates one counter for the page (section) and one counter for each <h1> element (subsection). The \"section\" counter will be counted for each <h1> element with \"Section <value of the section counter>. \", and the \"subsection\" counter will be counted for each <h2> element with \"<value of the section counter>.<value of the subsection counter>\": Example A counter can also be useful to make outlined lists because a new instance of a counter is automatically created in child elements. Here we use the counters() function to insert a string between different levels of nested counters: counters() Example CSS Counter Properties"

    "document": "CSS Website Layout Website Layout A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer: There are tons of different layout designs to choose from. However, the structure above, is one of the most common, and we will take a closer look at it in this tutorial. Header A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name: Example Result Header Navigation Bar A navigation bar contains a list of links to help visitors navigating through your website: Example Result Content The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following: 1-column:  2-column:  3-column: We will create a 3-column layout, and change it to a 1-column layout on smaller screens: Example Result Column Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas sit amet pretium urna. Vivamus venenatis velit nec neque ultricies, eget elementum magna tristique. Column Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas sit amet pretium urna. Vivamus venenatis velit nec neque ultricies, eget elementum magna tristique. Column Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas sit amet pretium urna. Vivamus venenatis velit nec neque ultricies, eget elementum magna tristique. Tip: To create a 2-column layout, change the width to 50%. To create a 4-column layout, use 25%, etc. Tip: Do you wonder how the @media rule works? Read more about it in our CSS Media Queries chapter. Tip: A more modern way of creating column layouts, is to use CSS Flexbox. However, it is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 and earlier versions. If you require IE6-10 support, use floats (as shown above). To learn more about the Flexible Box Layout Module, read our CSS Flexbox chapter. Unequal Columns The main content is the biggest and the most important part of your site. It is common with unequal column widths, so that most of the space is reserved for the main content. The side content (if any) is often used as an alternative navigation or to specify information relevant to the main content. Change the widths as you like, only remember that it should add up to 100% in total: Example Result Side Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit... Main Content Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas sit amet pretium urna. Vivamus venenatis velit nec neque ultricies, eget elementum magna tristique. Quisque vehicula, risus eget aliquam placerat, purus leo tincidunt eros, eget luctus quam orci in velit. Praesent scelerisque tortor sed accumsan convallis.

However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted. 0 For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed. There are two types of length units: absolute and relative. Absolute Lengths The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size. Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout. * Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels. Relative Lengths Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums. Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout! * Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the length unit."

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF) WOFF is a font format for use in web pages. It was developed in 2009, and is now a W3C Recommendation. WOFF is essentially OpenType or TrueType with compression and additional metadata. The goal is to support font distribution from a server to a client over a network with bandwidth constraints. The Web Open Font Format (WOFF 2.0) TrueType/OpenType font that provides better compression than WOFF 1.0. SVG Fonts/Shapes SVG fonts allow SVG to be used as glyphs when displaying text. The SVG 1.1 specification define a font module that allows the creation of fonts within an SVG document. You can also apply CSS to SVG documents, and the @font-face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents. Embedded OpenType Fonts (EOT) EOT fonts are a compact form of OpenType fonts designed by Microsoft for use as embedded fonts on web pages. Browser Support for Font Formats The numbers in the table specifies the first browser version that fully supports the font format. *IE: The font format only works when set to be \"installable\". Using The Font You Want In the @font-face rule; first define a name for the font (e.g. myFirstFont) and then point to the font file. @font-face Tip: Always use lowercase letters for the font URL. Uppercase letters can give unexpected results in IE. To use the font for an HTML element, refer to the name of the font (myFirstFont) through the font-family property: font-family Example Using Bold Text You must add another @font-face rule containing descriptors for bold text: @font-face Example The file \"sansation_bold.woff\" is another font file, that contains the bold characters for the Sansation font. Browsers will use this whenever a piece of text with the font-family \"myFirstFont\" should render as bold. This way you can have many @font-face rules for the same font. @font-face CSS Font Descriptors The following table lists all the font descriptors that can be defined inside the @font-face rule: @font-face"

In this chapter you will learn about the following properties: @keyframes animation-name animation-duration animation-delay animation-iteration-count animation-direction animation-timing-function animation-fill-mode animation What are CSS Animations? An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want. To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times. The @keyframes Rule When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times. @keyframes To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element. The following example binds the \"example\" animation to the <div> element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the <div> element from \"red\" to \"yellow\": Example Note: The animation-duration property defines how long an animation should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds). animation-duration animation-duration In the example above we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords \"from\" and \"to\" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)). It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like. The following example will change the background-color of the <div> element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete: Example The following example will change both the background-color and the position of the <div> element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete: Example Delay an Animation The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation. animation-delay The following example has a 2 seconds delay before starting the animation: Example Negative values are also allowed. If using negative values, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for N seconds. In the following example, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for 2 seconds: Example Set How Many Times an Animation Should Run The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run. animation-iteration-count The following example will run the animation 3 times before it stops: Example The following example uses the value \"infinite\" to make the animation continue for ever: Example Run Animation in Reverse Direction or Alternate Cycles The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles."

Demo: Tooltip Examples A tooltip is often used to specify extra information about something when the user moves the mouse pointer over an element:  Basic Tooltip Create a tooltip that appears when the user moves the mouse over an element: Example Example Explained HTML: Use a container element (like <div>) and add the \"tooltip\" class to it. When the user mouse over this <div>, it will show the tooltip text. \"tooltip\" The tooltip text is placed inside an inline element (like <span>) with class=\"tooltiptext\". class=\"tooltiptext\" CSS: The tooltip class use position:relative, which is needed to position the tooltip text (position:absolute). Note: See examples below on how to position the tooltip. tooltip position:relative position:absolute The tooltiptext class holds the actual tooltip text. It is hidden by default, and will be visible on hover (see below). We have also added some basic styles to it: 120px width, black background color, white text color, centered text, and 5px top and bottom padding. tooltiptext The CSS border-radius property is used to add rounded corners to the tooltip text. border-radius The :hover selector is used to show the tooltip text when the user moves the mouse over the <div> with class=\"tooltip\". :hover class=\"tooltip\" Positioning Tooltips In this example, the tooltip is placed to the right (left:105%) of the \"hoverable\" text (<div>). Also note that top:-5px is used to place it in the middle of its container element. We use the number 5 because the tooltip text has a top and bottom padding of 5px. If you increase its padding, also increase the value of the top property to ensure that it stays in the middle (if this is something you want). The same applies if you want the tooltip placed to the left. left:105% top:-5px top Right Tooltip Result: Left Tooltip Result: If you want the tooltip to appear on top or on the bottom, see examples below. Note that we use the margin-left property with a value of minus 60 pixels. This is to center the tooltip above/below the hoverable text. It is set to the half of the tooltip's width (120/2 = 60). margin-left Top Tooltip Result: Bottom Tooltip Result: Tooltip Arrows To create an arrow that should appear from a specific side of the tooltip, add \"empty\" content after tooltip, with the pseudo-element class ::after together with the content property. The arrow itself is created using borders. This will make the tooltip look like a speech bubble. ::after content This example demonstrates how to add an arrow to the bottom of the tooltip: Bottom Arrow Result: Example Explained Position the arrow inside the tooltip: top: 100% will place the arrow at the bottom of the tooltip. left: 50% will center the arrow. top: 100% left: 50% Note: The border-width property specifies the size of the arrow.

    "document": "CSS Media Queries CSS Media Queries The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types. @media Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device. Media queries can be used to check many things, such as: Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones). CSS Media Types CSS Common Media Features Here are some commonly used media features: Media Query Syntax A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more media features, which resolve to either true or false. The mediatype is optional (if omitted, it will be set to all). However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a mediatype. The result of the query is true if the specified media type matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all media features in the media query are true. When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules. Meaning of the not, only, and and keywords: not: This keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query. only: This keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries from applying the specified styles. It has no effect on modern browsers. and: This keyword combines a media type and one or more media features. You can also link to different stylesheets for different media and different widths of the browser window (viewport): Media Queries Simple Examples One way to use media queries is to have an alternate CSS section right inside your style sheet. The following example changes the background-color to lightgreen if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels, the background-color will be pink): Example The following example shows a menu that will float to the left of the page if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels, the menu will be on top of the content): Example More Media Query Examples For much more examples on media queries, go to the next page: CSS MQ Examples.

To demonstrate a simple example, we can change the background color for different devices: Example Do you wonder why we use exactly 992px and 600px? They are what we call \"typical breakpoints\" for devices. You can read more about typical breakpoints in our Responsive Web Design Tutorial. Media Queries For Menus In this example, we use media queries to create a responsive navigation menu, that varies in design on different screen sizes. Large screens: Small screens: Example Media Queries For Columns A common use of media queries, is to create a flexible layout. In this example, we create a layout that varies between four, two and full-width columns, depending on different screen sizes: Large screens:  Medium screens:  Small screens: Example Tip: A more modern way of creating column layouts, is to use CSS Flexbox (see example below). However, it is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 and earlier versions. If you require IE6-10 support, use floats (as shown above).

Example Hide Elements With Media Queries Another common use of media queries, is to hide elements on different screen sizes: Example Change Font Size With Media Queries You can also use media queries to change the font size of an element on different screen sizes: Variable Font Size. Example Flexible Image Gallery In this example, we use media queries together with flexbox to create a responsive image gallery: Example Flexible Website In this example, we use media queries together with flexbox to create a responsive website, containing a flexible navigation bar and flexible content. Example Orientation: Portrait / Landscape Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the orientation of the browser. You can have a set of CSS properties that will only apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a so called \"Landscape\" orientation: Example Use a lightblue background color if the orientation is in landscape mode: Min Width to Max Width You can also use the (max-width: ..) and (min-width: ..) values to set a minimum width and a maximum width.

CSS Grid Components A grid always consists of: Grid Container and Grid Items A grid layout consists of a parent element (the grid container), with one or more grid items. All direct children of the grid container automatically become grid items. Example Result: Try it Yourself » Display Grid Property The <div> element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid. <div> display grid inline-grid Example Result: Try it Yourself » Example Result: Try it Yourself » All CSS Grid Properties"

Direct child elements(s) of the grid container automatically becomes grid items. An element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid. display grid inline-grid Grid Tracks The rows and columns of a grid is defined with the grid-template-rows and the grid-template-columns properties (or the shorthand grid or grid-template properties). grid-template-rows grid-template-columns grid grid-template These define the grid tracks. A grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines. The grid-template-columns Property The grid-template-columns property defines the number of columns in your grid layout, and it can define the width of each column. grid-template-columns The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the width of the respective column. If you want your grid layout to contain 4 columns, specify the width of the 4 columns, or \"auto\" if all columns should have the same width. Example Make a grid with 4 columns of equal width: Result: Try it Yourself » The grid-template-columns property can also be used to specify the exact size (width) of the columns, or a mix of fixed size and auto. grid-template-columns Example Set a fixed size for column 1, 2, and 4, and keep column 3 as auto size: Result: Try it Yourself » Note: If you have more than 4 grid items in a 4 columns grid, the grid will automatically add a new row to put the items in. Cell Sizing with the fr Unit The fr unit can be used when defining grids, like any other CSS length such as %, px or em. fr The fr unit stands for \"fraction\". This unit automatically divides the available space into fractions. fr Example: 1fr will take 1 fraction of the available space, while 2fr will take 2 fractions of the available space. Example Here, each column will take up 25% of the container width, splitting it equally: Result: Try it Yourself » Example Here, the second column will be twice as big as the others: Result: Try it Yourself » The grid-template-rows Property The grid-template-rows property defines the height of each row. grid-template-rows The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the height of the respective row: Example Result: Try it Yourself » Notice that the first row in the grid above is 80px high and the second row is 200px high.

Responsive web design is not a program or a JavaScript. Designing For The Best Experience For All Users Web pages can be viewed using many different devices: desktops, tablets, and phones. Your web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device. Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to fit any device: It is called responsive web design when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen."

  {
    "document": "Responsive Web Design - The Viewport What is The Viewport? The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size. Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen. This was not perfect!! But a quick fix. Setting The Viewport HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag. <meta> You should include the following <meta> viewport element in the <head> section of all your web pages: <meta> <head> This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). width=device-width The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. initial-scale=1.0 Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links above to see the difference. Size Content to The Viewport Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile devices - but not horizontally! So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the whole web page it results in a poor user experience. Some additional rules to follow: 1. Do NOT use large fixed-width elements - For example, if an image has a width wider than the viewport, it causes the viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within the width of the viewport. 2. Do NOT let the content rely on a particular width to render well - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well. 3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements will cause the elements to be too wide for smaller devices. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices."

    "document": "Responsive Web Design - Building a Grid View What is a Grid-View? Many web pages are based on a grid-view, which means that the page is divided into rows and columns. Using a grid-view is very helpful when designing web pages. It makes it easier to place elements on the page. A responsive grid-view often has 6 or 12 columns, and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window. Building a Grid View Lets start building a grid-view. First ensure that all HTML elements have the box-sizing property set to border-box. This makes sure that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of the elements. box-sizing border-box Add the following at the begnning of your CSS: Read more about the box-sizing property in our CSS Box Sizing chapter. box-sizing The HTML We create a grid container with five grid items (item1 = Header, item2 = Menu, item3 = Main content, item4 = right, item5 = Footer): HTML Here is the complete HTML: The CSS We also want to add some styles and colors to make it look better: Note: The webpage in the example below is responsive, but it does not look good when you resize the browser window to a very small width.

    "document": "Responsive Web Design - Media Queries What is a Media Query? Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true. @media Example If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue: Add a Breakpoint Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen. Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint. Example Here we use a media query to add a breakpoint at 600px: Another Breakpoint You can add as many breakpoints as you like. We will also insert a breakpoint between tablets and mobile phones. Example Here we use media queries to add breakpoints when screen is max 600px, when screen is min 600px, and when screen is min 768px : Typical Device Breakpoints There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target five groups: Example Orientation: Portrait / Landscape Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the orientation of the browser. You can have a set of CSS properties that will only apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a so called \"Landscape\" orientation: Example The web page will have a lightblue background if the orientation is in landscape mode: Hide Elements With Media Queries Another common use of media queries, is to hide elements on different screen sizes: Example Change Font Size With Media Queries You can also use media queries to change the font size of an element on different screen sizes: Variable Font Size.

Using The width Property If the width property is set to a percentage and the height property is set to \"auto\", the image will be responsive and scale up and down: width height Example Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. max-width Using The max-width Property If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: max-width Example Add an Image to The Example Web Page Example Background Images Background images can also respond to resizing and scaling. Here we will show three different methods: 1. If the background-size property is set to \"contain\", the background image will scale, and try to fit the content area. However, the image will keep its aspect ratio (the proportional relationship between the image's width and height): background-size Here is the CSS code: Example 2. If the background-size property is set to \"100% 100%\", the background image will stretch to cover the entire content area: background-size Here is the CSS code: Example 3. If the background-size property is set to \"cover\", the background image will scale to cover the entire content area. Notice that the \"cover\" value keeps the aspect ratio, and some part of the background image may be clipped: background-size Here is the CSS code: Example Different Images for Different Devices A large image can be perfect on a big computer screen, but useless on a small device. Why load a large image when you have to scale it down anyway? To reduce the load, or for any other reasons, you can use media queries to display different images on different devices. Here is one large image and one smaller image that will be displayed on different devices: Example You can use the media query min-device-width, instead of min-width, which checks the device width, instead of the browser width. Then the image will not change when you resize the browser window: min-device-width min-width Example The HTML <picture> Element The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources. <picture> The most common use of the <picture> element will be for images used in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport. <picture> The <picture> element works similar to the <video> and <audio> elements. You set up different sources, and the first source that fits the preferences is the one being used: <picture> <video> <audio> Example The srcset attribute is required, and defines the source of the image. srcset The media attribute is optional, and accepts the media queries you find in CSS @media rule."

A Simple HTML Document Example Example Explained <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title> <body> <h1> <p> What is an HTML Element? An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! Web Browsers The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly. A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:  HTML Page Structure Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure: Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser.

Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit. Step 1: Open Notepad (PC) Windows 8 or later: Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad. Windows 7 or earlier: Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac) Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose \"Plain Text\" Then under \"Open and Save\", check the box that says \"Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text\". Then open a new document to place the code. Step 2: Write Some HTML Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:  Step 3: Save the HTML Page Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu. Name the file \"index.htm\" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files). Tip: You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference; it is up to you.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive. <!DOCTYPE> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE> HTML Headings HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> <h6> <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: <h1> <h6> Example HTML Paragraphs HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: <p> Example HTML Links HTML links are defined with the <a> tag: <a> Example The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. href Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

How did they do that?\" View HTML Source Code: Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select \"View Page Source\". This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.

The src Attribute The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: <img> src Example There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute: src 1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg\". Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed. 2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src=\"img_girl.jpg\". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src=\"/images/img_girl.jpg\". Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain. The width and height Attributes The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels): <img> width height Example The alt Attribute The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. alt <img> src Example Example See what happens if we try to display an image that does not exist: You will learn more about images in our HTML Images chapter. The style Attribute The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. style Example You will learn more about styles in our HTML Styles chapter. The lang Attribute You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. lang <html> The following example specifies English as the language: Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country. lang The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country: You can see all the language codes in our HTML Language Code Reference.

Example HTML <address> for Contact Information The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article. <address> The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc. The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element. <address> <address> Example HTML <cite> for Work Title The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.). <cite> Note: A person's name is not the title of a work. The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic. <cite> Example HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

RGB Color Values In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue) Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255. This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors! For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0. Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0. To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0). To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

    "document": "HTML Styles - CSS CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. CSS = Styles and Colors What is CSS? Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more! Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to \"blue\", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)! Using CSS CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: style <style> <head> <link> The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. Inline CSS An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element. style The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p> element to red: <h1> <p> Example Internal CSS An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element. <head> <style> The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a \"powderblue\" background color: <h1> <p> Example External CSS An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages. To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page: <head> Example The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension. Here is what the \"styles.css\" file looks like: \"styles.css\": Tip: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file! CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later. The CSS color property defines the text color to be used. color The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used. font-family The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used."

Using the width Property If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down: width Example Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. max-width Using the max-width Property If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: max-width Example Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes. <picture> Resize the browser window to see how the image below changes depending on the width: Example Responsive Text Size The text size can be set with a \"vw\" unit, which means the \"viewport width\". That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window: Hello World Resize the browser window to see how the text size scales. Example Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm. Media Queries In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages. With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.

This attribute is important if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. alt Also, always define the width and height of images. This reduces flickering, because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading. width height Good: Bad: Spaces and Equal Signs HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together. Good: Bad: Avoid Long Code Lines When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code. Try to avoid too long code lines. Blank Lines and Indentation Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason. For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks. For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.

Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive: \"london.jpg\" can be accessed as \"London.jpg\". If you use a mix of uppercase and lowercase, you have to be aware of this. If you move from a case-insensitive to a case-sensitive server, even small errors will break your web! To avoid these problems, always use lowercase file names! File Extensions HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed). CSS files should have a .css extension. JavaScript files should have a .js extension. Differences Between .htm and .html?

Entity names look like this: Entity numbers look like this: To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60; Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers. Non-breaking Space A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp; A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line. Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive. Examples: Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages. If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity. The non-breaking hyphen (&#8209;) is used to define a hyphen character (‑) that does not break into a new line. Some Useful HTML Character Entities Note Entity names are case sensitive. Combining Diacritical Marks A diacritical mark is a \"glyph\" added to a letter. Some diacritical marks, like grave ( ̀) and acute ( ́) are called accents.

The value of a disabled input field will not be sent when submitting the form! Example A disabled input field: The size Attribute The input size attribute specifies the visible width, in characters, of an input field. size The default value for size is 20. size Note: The size attribute works with the following input types: text, search, tel, url, email, and password. size Example Set a width for an input field: The maxlength Attribute The input maxlength attribute specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in an input field. maxlength Note: When a maxlength is set, the input field will not accept more than the specified number of characters. However, this attribute does not provide any feedback. So, if you want to alert the user, you must write JavaScript code. maxlength Example Set a maximum length for an input field: The min and max Attributes The input min and max attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for an input field. min max The min and max attributes work with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime-local, month, time and week. min max Tip: Use the max and min attributes together to create a range of legal values. Example Set a max date, a min date, and a range of legal values: The multiple Attribute The input multiple attribute specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in an input field. multiple The multiple attribute works with the following input types: email, and file. multiple Example A file upload field that accepts multiple values: The pattern Attribute The input pattern attribute specifies a regular expression that the input field's value is checked against, when the form is submitted. pattern The pattern attribute works with the following input types: text, date, search, url, tel, email, and password. pattern Tip: Use the global title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user.

If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. Without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).

    "document": "HTML - What is a Web API? A Web API is a developer's dream. What is Web API? API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is some kind of interface that includes a set of functions and subroutines that allow programmers to access specific features or data of an application, operating system or other services. A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web. HTML APIs All browsers have a set of built-in Web APIs to support complex operations, and to help accessing data. Here are some of the main HTML5 APIs: 1. Geolocation API - This API is used to access the current location of a user (with latitude and longitude). 2. Drag and Drop API - This API enables you to use drag-and-drop features in browsers. 3. Web Storage API - This API has mechanisms to let browsers store key/value pairs (in a more intuitive way than cookies). 4. Web Workers API - This API allows a JavaScript to run in the background, without affecting the performance of the page. Users can continue to do whatever they want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background. 5. Server-Sent Events API - This API allows a web page to automatically get updates from a server. 6. Canvas API - This API lets you draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript. Notes on Using HTML APIs When implementing an HTML API, you should always: Check Browser Capability - Always check that the target browsers support the API. Always add script or message to be run if a browser does not support it. Add Robust Error Handling - Add robust error handling to take care of scenarios where an API may not function as expected, to ensure a seamless user experience. Request User Permission - When using an API that accesses sensitive data, like the Geolocation API (which will access the user's geographical position), always prompt the user for consent before proceeding. Third Party APIs Third party APIs are not built into your browser. To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web. Examples:"

Tip: The Geolocation API is most accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones or smartwatches. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports Geolocation. Using HTML Geolocation API The Geolocation API is accessed via a call to navigator.geolocation. This will cause the browser to ask the user for permission to access their location data.

HTML Drag and Drop API Example The example below is a simple drag and drop example: Example It might seem complicated, but lets go through all the different parts of a drag and drop event. Make an Element Draggable First of all: To make an element draggable, set the draggable attribute to true: draggable or: What to Drag - ondragstart and setData() Then, specify what should happen when the element is dragged. In the example above, the ondragstart attribute of the <img> element calls a function (dragstartHandler(ev)), that specifies what data to be dragged. ondragstart The dataTransfer.setData() method sets the data type and the value of the dragged data: dataTransfer.setData() In this case, the data type is \"text\" and the value is the id of the draggable element (\"img1\"). Where to Drop - ondragover The ondragover attrribute of the <div> element calls a function (dragoverHandler(ev)), that specifies where the dragged data can be dropped. ondragover By default, data/elements cannot be dropped in other elements. To allow a drop, we must prevent the default handling of the element. This is done by calling the preventDefault() method for the ondragover event: preventDefault() Do the Drop - ondrop When the dragged data is dropped, a drop event occurs. In the example above, the ondrop attribute of the <div> element calls a function, dropHandler(event): Code explained: preventDefault() dataTransfer.getData() setData() More Examples Example How to drag and drop an <h1> element to a <div> element: Example How to drag and drop an <a> element to a <div> element: Example How to drag and drop an image back and forth between two <div> elements:"

    "document": "HTML Web Storage API HTML Web Storage API; better than cookies. What is HTML Web Storage? With web storage, applications can store data locally within the user's browser. Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server. Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data. Web Storage API Objects Web storage provides two objects for storing data in the browser: window.localStorage window.sessionStorage Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports Web Storage. Test Web Storage API Support Before using web storage, we can quickly check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage: Example Test browser support: The localStorage Object The localStorage object stores the data with no expiration date. The data will not be lost when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year. localStorage Example Use localStorage to set and retrieve name and value pairs: localStorage Example explained: localStorage.setItem() localStorage.getItem() The syntax for removing the \"lastname\" localStorage item is as follows: Note: Name/value pairs are always stored as strings. Remember to convert them to another format when needed! Counting Clicks with localStorage The following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button. In this code the value string is converted to a number to be able to increase the counter: Example The sessionStorage Object The sessionStorage object is equal to the localStorage object, except that it stores the data for only one session! The data is deleted when the user closes the specific browser tab. sessionStorage localStorage Counting Clicks with sessionStorage The following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button, in the current session: Example"

    "document": "HTML Web Workers API A web worker is an external JavaScript file that runs in the background, without affecting the performance of the page. What is a Web Worker? When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished. A web worker is an external JavaScript file that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background. Web workers are useful for heavy code that can't be run on the main thread, without causing long tasks that make the page unresponsive. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully support the Web Workers API. Web Workers API Example The example below creates a simple web worker that count numbers in the background: Example Start Worker Stop Worker Note: Normally web workers are not used for such simple scripts, but for more CPU intensive tasks! Check Web Worker API Support Before using web worker, we can quickly check browser support: Example Test browser support: Create a .js Web Worker File Now, let's create a web worker in an external JavaScript file. Here we create a script that counts. The script is stored in the \"demo_workers.js\" file: Note: The important part of the code above is the postMessage() method - which is used to post messages back to the HTML page. postMessage() Create a Web Worker Object Once we have created the .js web worker file, we can call it from an HTML page. The following lines checks if a worker (w) already exists, if not - it creates a new web worker object and points to the .js file: \"demo_workers.js\": Then we can SEND and RETRIEVE messages from the web worker. Data is sent between web workers and the main thread via a system of messages - both sides send their messages using the postMessage() method, and respond to messages via the onmessage event handler. postMessage() onmessage Add an onmessage event listener to the web worker object. onmessage When the web worker in the .js posts a message, the code within the event listener is executed. The data from the web worker is stored in event.data. event.data Terminate a Web Worker When a web worker object is created, it will continue to listen for messages until it is terminated. To terminate a web worker object, and free browser/computer resources, use the terminate() method: terminate() Reuse the Web Worker If you set the web worker variable to undefined, after it has been terminated, you can reuse the worker/code: Full Web Worker Example We have already seen the Web Worker code in the .js file. Below is the full code for the HTML page: Example Web Workers and the DOM Since web workers are in external .js files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:"

    "document": "HTML Accessibility HTML Accessibility Always write HTML code with accessibility in mind! Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible. Semantic HTML Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the <button> element (and not a <div> element). <button> <div> Semantic Non-semantic Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud. With the button example in mind: A button is also accessible for people relying on keyboard-only navigation; it can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be tabbed between (using the tab key on the keyboard). Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. <div> <span> Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content. <form> <table> <article> Headings Are Important Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags: <h1> <h6> Example Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections. Screen readers also use headings as a navigational tool. The different types of heading specify the outline of the page. <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on. <h1> <h2> <h3> Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold. Alternative Text The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). alt src The value of the alt attribute should describe the image: alt Example If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute: alt Example Declare the Language You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. lang <html> The following example specifies English as the language: Use Clear Language Always use a clear language, that is easy to understand. Also try to avoid characters that cannot be read clearly by a screen reader. For example: Create Good Link Text A link text should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link.

It is common to name these errors HTML error messages. But these messages are something called HTTP status messages. In fact, the server always returns a message for every request.

    "document": "HTTP Request Methods What is HTTP? The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content. HTTP Methods The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST. The GET Method GET is used to request data from a specified resource. Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: Some notes on GET requests: The POST Method POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: Some notes on POST requests: Compare GET vs. POST The following table compares the two HTTP methods: GET and POST. The PUT Method PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times. The HEAD Method HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body. In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users. A HEAD request is useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - a HEAD request can read the Content-Length header to check the size of the file, without actually downloading the file. The DELETE Method The DELETE method deletes the specified resource. The PATCH Method The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource. The OPTIONS Method The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource. The CONNECT Method The CONNECT method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel) with the requested resource. The TRACE Method The TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test that tests the path for the target resource (useful for debugging purposes)."

Set a default pixel size: Convert PX to EM: px Convert EM to PX: em  Result: Body Font Size In the table below, select a body font size in pixels (px) to display a complete \"px to em and percent\" conversion table. Tip: The default font size is usually 16px. What is the difference between PX, EM and Percent? Pixel is a static measurement, while percent and EM are relative measurements. The size of an EM or percent depends on its parent. If the text size of body is 16 pixels, then 150% or 1.5 EM will be 24 pixels (1.5 * 16). Look at CSS Units for more measurement units."

However, it is possible to write Java in an Integrated Development Environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Netbeans or Eclipse, which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Java files. Java Quickstart In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename. Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad). The file should contain a \"Hello World\" message, which is written with the following code: Main.java public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); } } Try it Yourself » Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code above. Save the code in Notepad as \"Main.java\". Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe), navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and type \"javac Main.java\": This will compile your code. If there are no errors in the code, the command prompt will take you to the next line. Now, type \"java Main\" to run the file: The output should read: Hello World Congratulations!

This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve. Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it. Recursion Example Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers: Example Use recursion to add all of the numbers up to 10. public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int result = sum(10); System.out.println(result); } public static int sum(int k) { if (k > 0) { return k + sum(k - 1); } else { return 0; } } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int result = sum(10); System.out.println(result); public static int sum(int k) { if (k > 0) { return k + sum(k - 1); } else { return 0;   Try it Yourself » Example Explained When the sum() function is called, it adds parameter k to the sum of all numbers smaller than k and returns the result. When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When running, the program follows these steps: sum() k k Since the function does not call itself when k is 0, the program stops there and returns the result. k Halting Condition Just as loops can run into the problem of infinite looping, recursive functions can run into the problem of infinite recursion. Infinite recursion is when the function never stops calling itself. Every recursive function should have a halting condition, which is the condition where the function stops calling itself. In the previous example, the halting condition is when the parameter k becomes 0. k It is helpful to see a variety of different examples to better understand the concept. In this example, the function adds a range of numbers between a start and an end."

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods. Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming: Tip: The \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it. Java - What are Classes and Objects? Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming. Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects: class Fruit objects Apple Banana Mango Another example: class Car objects Volvo Audi Toyota So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class. You will learn much more about classes and objects in the next chapter."

    "document": "Java Classes and Objects Java Classes/Objects Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake. A Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. Create a Class To create a class, use the keyword class: class Main.java Create a class named \"Main\" with a variable x: Main public class Main { int x = 5; } public class Main { int x = 5; } Remember from the Java Syntax chapter that a class should always start with an uppercase first letter, and that the name of the java file should match the class name. Create an Object In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named Main, so now we can use this to create objects. Main To create an object of Main, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new: Main new Example Create an object called \"myObj\" and print the value of x: myObj public class Main { int x = 5; public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(); System.out.println(myObj.x); } } public class Main { int x = 5; public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(); System.out.println(myObj.x); } } Try it Yourself » Multiple Objects You can create multiple objects of one class: Example Create two objects of Main: Main public class Main { int x = 5; public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj1 = new Main(); // Object 1 Main myObj2 = new Main(); // Object 2 System.out.println(myObj1.x); System.out.println(myObj2.x); } } public class Main { int x = 5; public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj1 = new Main(); // Object 1 Main myObj2 = new Main(); // Object 2 System.out.println(myObj1.x); System.out.println(myObj2.x); } } Try it Yourself » Using Multiple Classes You can also create an object of a class and access it in another class. This is often used for better organization of classes (one class has all the attributes and methods, while the other class holds the main() method (code to be executed)). main() Remember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this example, we have created two files in the same directory/folder: public class Main { int x = 5; } public class Main { int x = 5; } class Second { public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(); System.out.println(myObj.x); } } class Second { public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(); System.out.println(myObj.x); } } When both files have been compiled: Run the Second.java file: And the output will be: 5 You will learn much more about classes and objects in the next chapters."

Main Main 6) Then, go to the main() method, which you know by now is a built-in Java method that runs your program (any code inside main is executed). main() 7) By using the new keyword we created an object with the name myCar. new myCar 8) Then, we call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program using the name of the object (myCar), followed by a dot (. ), followed by the name of the method (fullThrottle(); and speed(200);).

Constructor Parameters Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes. The following example adds an int y parameter to the constructor. Inside the constructor we set x to y (x=y). When we call the constructor, we pass a parameter to the constructor (5), which will set the value of x to 5: int y Example public class Main { int x; public Main(int y) { x = y; } public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(5); System.out.println(myObj.x); } } // Outputs 5 public class Main { int x; public Main(int y) { x = y; } public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(5); System.out.println(myObj.x); } } // Outputs 5 Try it Yourself » You can have as many parameters as you want: Example public class Main { int modelYear; String modelName; public Main(int year, String name) { modelYear = year; modelName = name; } public static void main(String[] args) { Main myCar = new Main(1969, \"Mustang\"); System.out.println(myCar.modelYear + \" \" + myCar.modelName); } } // Outputs 1969 Mustang public class Main { int modelYear; String modelName; public Main(int year, String name) { modelYear = year; modelName = name; } public static void main(String[] args) { Main myCar = new Main(1969, \"Mustang\"); System.out.println(myCar.modelYear + \" \" + myCar.modelName); } } // Outputs 1969 Mustang Try it Yourself »"

We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories: Built-in Packages The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment. The library contains components for managing input, database programming, and much much more. The complete list can be found at Oracles website: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/. The library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package. To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword: import Syntax import package.name.Class; // Import a single class import package.name. *; // Import the whole package import package.name.Class; // Import a single class import package.name. *; // Import the whole package Import a Class If you find a class you want to use, for example, the Scanner class, which is used to get user input, write the following code: Scanner Example import java.util.Scanner; import java.util.Scanner; In the example above, java.util is a package, while Scanner is a class of the java.util package. java.util Scanner java.util To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation. In our example, we will use the nextLine() method, which is used to read a complete line: Scanner Scanner nextLine() Example Using the Scanner class to get user input: Scanner import java.util.Scanner; class MyClass { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(\"Enter username\"); String userName = myObj.nextLine(); System.out.println(\"Username is: \" + userName); } } import java.util.Scanner; class MyClass { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(\"Enter username\"); String userName = myObj.nextLine(); System.out.println(\"Username is: \" + userName); } } Run Example » Import a Package There are many packages to choose from. In the previous example, we used the Scanner class from the java.util package. This package also contains date and time facilities, random-number generator and other utility classes. Scanner java.util To import a whole package, end the sentence with an asterisk sign (*). The following example will import ALL the classes in the java.util package: * java.util Example import java.util. *; import java.util. *; Run Example » User-defined Packages To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file system directory to store them. Just like folders on your computer: Example └── root └── mypack └── MyPackageClass.java To create a package, use the package keyword: package MyPackageClass.java package mypack; class MyPackageClass { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"This is my package! \"); } } package mypack; class MyPackageClass { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"This is my package!"

The -d keyword specifies the destination for where to save the class file. You can use any directory name, like c:/user (windows), or, if you want to keep the package within the same directory, you can use the dot sign \". \", like in the example above. -d . Note: The package name should be written in lower case to avoid conflict with class names. When we compiled the package in the example above, a new folder was created, called \"mypack\".

We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories: To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword. extends In the example below, the Car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (superclass): Car Vehicle Example class Vehicle { protected String brand = \"Ford\"; // Vehicle attribute public void honk() { // Vehicle method System.out.println(\"Tuut, tuut! \"); } } class Car extends Vehicle { private String modelName = \"Mustang\"; // Car attribute public static void main(String[] args) { // Create a myCar object Car myCar = new Car(); // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object myCar.honk(); // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class System.out.println(myCar.brand + \" \" + myCar.modelName); } } class Vehicle { protected String brand = \"Ford\"; // Vehicle attribute public void honk() { // Vehicle method System.out.println(\"Tuut, tuut! \"); } } class Car extends Vehicle { private String modelName = \"Mustang\"; // Car attribute public static void main(String[] args) { // Create a myCar object Car myCar = new Car(); // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object myCar.honk(); // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class System.out.println(myCar.brand + \" \" + myCar.modelName); } } Try it Yourself » Did you notice the protected modifier in Vehicle? protected We set the brand attribute in Vehicle to a protected access modifier.

Tip: Also take a look at the next chapter, Polymorphism, which uses inherited methods to perform different tasks. The final Keyword If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the final keyword: final If you try to access a final class, Java will generate an error: final final class Vehicle { ... } class Car extends Vehicle { ... } final class Vehicle { ... } class Car extends Vehicle { ... } The output will be something like this: Main.java:9: error: cannot inherit from final Vehicleclass Main extends Vehicle { ^ 1 error)"

Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways. For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc. ): Animal animalSound() Example class Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The animal makes a sound\"); } } class Pig extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\"); } } class Dog extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The dog says: bow wow\"); } } class Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The animal makes a sound\"); } } class Pig extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\"); } } class Dog extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The dog says: bow wow\"); } } Remember from the Inheritance chapter that we use the extends keyword to inherit from a class. extends Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and call the animalSound() method on both of them: Pig Dog animalSound() Example class Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The animal makes a sound\"); } } class Pig extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\"); } } class Dog extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The dog says: bow wow\"); } } class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Create a Animal object Animal myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Create a Dog object myAnimal.animalSound(); myPig.animalSound(); myDog.animalSound(); } } class Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The animal makes a sound\"); } } class Pig extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\"); } } class Dog extends Animal { public void animalSound() { System.out.println(\"The dog says: bow wow\"); } } class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Animal myAnimal = new Animal(); // Create a Animal object Animal myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Create a Dog object myAnimal.animalSound(); myPig.animalSound(); myDog.animalSound(); } } Try it Yourself » - It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class."

This method is useful when you want to loop through the constants of an enum: values() Example for (Level myVar : Level.values()) { System.out.println(myVar); } for (Level myVar : Level.values()) { System.out.println(myVar); } The output will be: LOW MEDIUM HIGH An enum can, just like a class, have attributes and methods. The only difference is that enum constants are public, static and final (unchangeable - cannot be overridden). enum class public static final An enum cannot be used to create objects, and it cannot extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces). enum Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc."

    "document": "Java Exceptions - Try...Catch Java Exceptions When executing Java code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things. When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw an exception (throw an error). Java try and catch The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. try The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. catch The try and catch keywords come in pairs: try catch Syntax try { // Block of code to try } catch(Exception e) { // Block of code to handle errors } try { // Block of code to try } catch(Exception e) { // Block of code to handle errors } Consider the following example: This will generate an error, because myNumbers[10] does not exist. public class Main { public static void main(String[ ] args) { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error! } } public class Main { public static void main(String[ ] args) { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error! } } The output will be something like this: Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10 at Main.main(Main.java:4) Note: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when you try to access an index number that does not exist. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException If an error occurs, we can use try...catch to catch the error and execute some code to handle it: try...catch Example public class Main { public static void main(String[ ] args) { try { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Something went wrong. \"); } } } public class Main { public static void main(String[ ] args) { try { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Something went wrong. \"); } } } The output will be: Something went wrong. Finally The finally statement lets you execute code, after try...catch, regardless of the result: finally try...catch Example public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Something went wrong. \"); } finally { System.out.println(\"The 'try catch' is finished. \"); } } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3}; System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Something went wrong. \"); } finally { System.out.println(\"The 'try catch' is finished. \"); } } } The output will be: Something went wrong.

When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for. A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern. Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the java.util.regex package to work with regular expressions.

First, the pattern is created using the Pattern.compile() method. The first parameter indicates which pattern is being searched for and the second parameter has a flag to indicates that the search should be case-insensitive. The second parameter is optional. Pattern.compile() The matcher() method is used to search for the pattern in a string. It returns a Matcher object which contains information about the search that was performed. matcher() The find() method returns true if the pattern was found in the string and false if it was not found. find() Flags Flags in the compile() method change how the search is performed. Here are a few of them: compile() Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE Pattern.LITERAL Pattern.UNICODE_CASE CASE_INSENSITIVE Regular Expression Patterns The first parameter of the Pattern.compile() method is the pattern. It describes what is being searched for.

They have to immediately return a value, and they cannot contain variables, assignments or statements such as if or for. In order to do more complex operations, a code block can be used with curly braces. If the lambda expression needs to return a value, then the code block should have a return statement. if for return (parameter1, parameter2) -> { code block } (parameter1, parameter2) -> { code block } Using Lambda Expressions Lambda expressions are usually passed as parameters to a function: Example Use a lambda expression in the ArrayList's forEach() method to print every item in the list: ArrayList forEach() import java.util.ArrayList; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); numbers.add(5); numbers.add(9); numbers.add(8); numbers.add(1); numbers.forEach( (n) -> { System.out.println(n); } ); } } import java.util.ArrayList; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); numbers.add(5); numbers.add(9); numbers.add(8); numbers.add(1); numbers.forEach( (n) -> { System.out.println(n); } ); } } Try it Yourself » Lambda expressions can be stored in variables if the variable's type is an interface which has only one method.

The Comparator and Comparable interfaces allow you to specify what rule is used to sort objects. Comparator Comparable Being able to specify a sorting rule also allows you to change how strings and numbers are sorted.

Comparable compareTo() The compareTo() method takes an object as an argument and compares the comparable with the argument to decide which one should go first in a list. compareTo() Like the comparator, the compareTo() method returns a number which is: compareTo() Many native Java classes implement the Comparable interface, such as String and Integer. Comparable String Integer This is why strings and numbers do not need a comparator to be sorted."

The token must represent a whole number between -32,768 and 32,767. nextShort() short The scanner is able to interpret digit groupings, such as using a comma for separating groups of 3 digits. The format of the groupings depends on the locale settings of the scanner, which can be changed with the useLocale() method. useLocale() If the radix parameter is used, then it interprets numbers using the radix. For example, a radix of 16 would interpret numbers as hexadecimal (digits 0 to 9 and A to F). If the radix parameter is not used then it interprets numbers using the scanner's radix which is 10 by default, but it can be changed with the useRadix() method. useRadix() What is a token? A token is a sequence of characters separated from other tokens by delimiters. The default delimiter is a block of whitespace characters but it can be changed with the useDelimiter() method. useDelimiter() Syntax One of the following: public short nextShort() public short nextShort() public short nextShort(int radix) public short nextShort(int radix) Parameter Values Technical Details short InputMismatchException short NoSuchElementException IllegalStateException ❮ Scanner Methods"

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements. In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser. JavaScript Statements JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. This statement tells the browser to write \"Hello Dolly.\" inside an HTML element with id=\"demo\": Example Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written. JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code. Semicolons ; Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement: Examples When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed: On the web, you might see examples without semicolons. Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended. JavaScript White Space JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable. The following lines are equivalent: A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ): JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator: Example JavaScript Code Blocks JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}. The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together. One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions: Example In this tutorial we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks. You will learn more about functions later in this tutorial. JavaScript Keywords JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6: JavaScript Operators JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values: + - * / JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables: = JavaScript Expressions An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value. The computation is called an evaluation. For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50: Expressions can also contain variable values: The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings. For example, \"John\" + \" \" + \"Doe\", evaluates to \"John Doe\": JavaScript Keywords JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed. The let keyword tells the browser to create variables: let The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables: var In these examples, using var or let will produce the same result. var let You will learn more about var and let later in this tutorial. var let JavaScript Comments Not all JavaScript statements are \"executed\". Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment. // /* */ Comments are ignored, and will not be executed: You will learn more about comments in a later chapter. JavaScript Identifiers / Names Identifiers are JavaScript names. Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions. The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages. A JavaScript name must begin with: Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. Note Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names. This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers. JavaScript is Case Sensitive All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables: lastName lastname JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let. JavaScript and Camel Case Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name: Hyphens: first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city. Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions. Underscore: first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city. Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case): FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity. Lower Camel Case: JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity. JavaScript Character Set JavaScript uses the Unicode character set."

From the examples you can guess: Example using var Note The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. var The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. let const The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers. var Example using let Example using const Mixed Example The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword. price1 price2 const These are constant values and cannot be changed. The variable total is declared with the let keyword. total let The value total can be changed. total When to Use var, let, or const? 1. Always declare variables 2. Always use const if the value should not be changed const 3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects) const 4. Only use let if you can't use const let const 5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers. var Just Like Algebra Just like in algebra, variables hold values: Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions: From the example above, you can guess that the total is calculated to be 11. Note Variables are containers for storing values. JavaScript Identifiers All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: Note JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive. The Assignment Operator In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an \"assignment\" operator, not an \"equal to\" operator. = This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra: In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x. (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.) Note The \"equal to\" operator is written like == in JavaScript. == JavaScript Data Types JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like \"John Doe\". In programming, text values are called text strings. JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings. Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string. Example Declaring a JavaScript Variable Creating a variable in JavaScript is called \"declaring\" a variable. You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword: var let After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined)."

Now try this: Example JavaScript Dollar Sign $ Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names: Example Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

Arithmetic Operations A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers. The two numbers can be literals: Example or variables: Example or expressions: Example Operators and Operands The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands. The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator. Adding The addition operator (+) adds numbers: + Example Subtracting The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers. - Example Multiplying The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. * Example Dividing The division operator (/) divides numbers. / Example Remainder The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder. % Example In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder. In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division. Incrementing The increment operator (++) increments numbers. ++ Example Decrementing The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers. -- Example Exponentiation The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. ** Example x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y): Math.pow(x,y) Example Operator Precedence Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. Example Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150? Is the addition or the multiplication done first? As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first. Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). * / + - And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses. When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first: Example When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right: Examples Note For a full list of operator precedence values go to: JavaScript Operator Precedence Values."

Examples Note A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data. The Concept of Data Types In programming, data types is an important concept. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type. Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this: Does it make any sense to add \"Volvo\" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result? JavaScript will treat the example above as: Note When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string. Example Example JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results: JavaScript: Result: 20Volvo JavaScript: Result: Volvo164 In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches \"Volvo\". In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings. JavaScript Types are Dynamic JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types: Example JavaScript Strings A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like \"John Doe\". Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes: Example You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: Example You will learn more about strings later in this tutorial. JavaScript Numbers All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).

JavaScript Object Definition How to Define a JavaScript Object new JavaScript Object Literal An object literal is a list of name:value pairs inside curly braces {}. Note: name:value pairs are also called key:value pairs. object literals are also called object initializers.

An object initializer can span multiple lines: This example creates an empty JavaScript object, and then adds 4 properties: Using the new Keyword This example create a new JavaScript object using new Object(), and then adds 4 properties: new Object() Example Note: The examples above do exactly the same. But, there is no need to use new Object(). new Object() For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method. Object Properties The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties. Objects written as name value pairs are similar to: Accessing Object Properties You can access object properties in two ways: Examples JavaScript Object Methods Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are function definitions stored as property values. Example In the example above, this refers to the person object: this this.firstName means the firstName property of person. this.lastName means the lastName property of person. In JavaScript, Objects are King. Objects are containers for Properties and Methods. Properties are named Values. Methods are Functions stored as Properties. Properties can be primitive values, functions, or even other objects. In JavaScript, almost \"everything\" is an object. All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects. JavaScript Primitives A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods. 3.14 is a primitive value A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value. JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types: string number boolean null undefined symbol bigint Immutable Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed). if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14."

Example Some solutions to display JavaScript objects are: Displaying the Object Properties by name Displaying the Object Properties in a Loop Displaying the Object using Object.values() Displaying the Object using JSON.stringify() Displaying Object Properties The properties of an object can be displayed as a string: Example Displaying Properties in a Loop The properties of an object can be collected in a loop: Example Note: You must use person[x] in the loop. person.x will not work (Because x is the loop variable). Using Object.values() Object.values() creates an array from the property values: Object.values() Using Object.entries() Object.entries() makes it simple to use objects in loops: Object.entries() Example Using JSON.stringify() JavaScript objects can be converted to a string with JSON method JSON.stringify(). JSON.stringify() JSON.stringify() is included in JavaScript and supported in all major browsers. JSON.stringify() Note: The result will be a string written in JSON notation: {\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":50,\"city\":\"New York\"} Example Complete Object Reference For a complete reference, go to our: Complete JavaScript Object Reference.

Not to any other Person Objects. Adding a Property to a Constructor You can NOT add a new property to an object constructor: Example To add a new property, you must add it to the constructor function prototype: Example Constructor Function Methods A constructor function can also have methods: Example Adding a Method to an Object Adding a method to a created object is easy: Example Note: The new method will be added to myMother. Not to any other Person Objects. Adding a Method to a Constructor You cannot add a new method to an object constructor function. This code will produce a TypeError: Example TypeError: myMother.changeName is not a function TypeError: myMother.changeName is not a function Adding a new method must be done to the constructor function prototype: Example Note: The changeName() function assigns the value of name to the person's lastName property, substituting this with myMother. name lastName this myMother Built-in JavaScript Constructors JavaScript has built-in constructors for all native objects: Note: The Math() object is not in the list. Math is a global object. The new keyword cannot be used on Math. Math() Math new Math Did You Know?

HTML Events An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. Here are some examples of HTML events: Often, when events happen, you may want to do something. JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements. With single quotes: With double quotes: In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element: onclick <button> Example In the example above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id=\"demo\". In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML): this.innerHTML Example JavaScript code is often several lines long.

Example You can use single or double quotes: Example Note Strings created with single or double quotes work the same. There is no difference between the two. Quotes Inside Quotes You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string: Example Template Strings Templates were introduced with ES6 (JavaScript 2016). Templates are strings enclosed in backticks (`This is a template string`). Templates allow single and double quotes inside a string: Example Try it Yourself » Note Templates are not supported in Internet Explorer. String Length To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property: length Example Escape Characters Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string: The string will be chopped to \"We are the so-called \". To solve this problem, you can use an backslash escape character. The backslash escape character (\\) turns special characters into string characters: \\ Examples \\\" inserts a double quote in a string: let text = \"We are the so-called \\\"Vikings\\\" from the north. \"; Try it Yourself » \\' inserts a single quote in a string: let text= 'It\\'s alright.

Example Slice out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 13: Note JavaScript counts positions from zero. First position is 0. Second position is 1. Examples If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string: If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string: This example slices out a portion of a string from position -12 to position -6: JavaScript String substring() substring() is similar to slice(). substring() slice() The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring(). substring() Example If you omit the second parameter, substring() will slice out the rest of the string. substring() JavaScript String substr() substr() is similar to slice(). substr() slice() The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this: However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300? The solution is an array! An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number. Creating an Array Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array. Syntax: It is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword. Learn more about const with arrays in the chapter: JS Array Const. Example Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines: Example You can also create an array, and then provide the elements: Example Using the JavaScript Keyword new The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it: Example The two examples above do exactly the same. There is no need to use new Array(). new Array() For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method. Accessing Array Elements You access an array element by referring to the index number: Note: Array indexes start with 0. [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element. Changing an Array Element This statement changes the value of the first element in cars: cars Example Converting an Array to a String The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array values. toString() Example Result: Access the Full Array With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name: Example Arrays are Objects Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns \"object\" for arrays. typeof But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays. Arrays use numbers to access its \"elements\". In this example, person[0] returns John: person[0] Array: Objects use names to access its \"members\". In this example, person.firstName returns John: person.firstName Object: Array Elements Can Be Objects JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects. Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array. You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array: Array Properties and Methods The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods: Array methods are covered in the next chapters.

If numbers are sorted as strings, \"25\" is bigger than \"100\", because \"2\" is bigger than \"1\". Because of this, the sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers. sort() You can fix this by providing a compare function: Example Use the same trick to sort an array descending: Example The Compare Function The purpose of the compare function is to define an alternative sort order. The compare function should return a negative, zero, or positive value, depending on the arguments: When the sort() function compares two values, it sends the values to the compare function, and sorts the values according to the returned (negative, zero, positive) value. sort() If the result is negative, a is sorted before b. a b If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. b a If the result is 0, no changes are done with the sort order of the two values. Example: The compare function compares all the values in the array, two values at a time (a, b). (a, b) When comparing 40 and 100, the sort() method calls the compare function(40, 100). sort() The function calculates 40 - 100 (a - b), and since the result is negative (-60), the sort function will sort 40 as a value lower than 100.

The computer clock is ticking, date objects are not. JavaScript Date Output By default, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone and display a date as a full text string:  You will learn much more about how to display dates, later in this tutorial. Creating Date Objects Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor. new Date() There are 9 ways to create a new date object: JavaScript new Date() new Date() creates a date object with the current date and time: new Date() Example new Date(date string) new Date(date string) creates a date object from a date string: new Date(date string) Examples Date string formats are described in the next chapter. new Date(year, month, ...) new Date(year, month, ...) creates a date object with a specified date and time. new Date(year, month, ...) 7 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond (in that order): Example Note JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11: January = 0. December = 11. Specifying a month higher than 11, will not result in an error but add the overflow to the next year: Specifying: Is the same as: Specifying a day higher than max, will not result in an error but add the overflow to the next month: Specifying: Is the same as: Using 6, 4, 3, or 2 Numbers 6 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second: Example 5 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, and minute: Example 4 numbers specify year, month, day, and hour: Example 3 numbers specify year, month, and day: Example 2 numbers specify year and month: Example You cannot omit month. If you supply only one parameter it will be treated as milliseconds. Example Previous Century One and two digit years will be interpreted as 19xx: Example Example JavaScript Stores Dates as Milliseconds JavaScript stores dates as number of milliseconds since January 01, 1970. Zero time is January 01, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. One day (24 hours) is 86 400 000 milliseconds. Now the time is: milliseconds past January 01, 1970 new Date(milliseconds) new Date(milliseconds) creates a new date object as milliseconds plus zero time: new Date(milliseconds) Examples 01 January 1970 plus 100 000 000 000 milliseconds is: January 01 1970 minus 100 000 000 000 milliseconds is: January 01 1970 plus 24 hours is: 01 January 1970 plus 0 milliseconds is: Date Methods When a date object is created, a number of methods allow you to operate on it. Date methods allow you to get and set the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond of date objects, using either local time or UTC (universal, or GMT) time.

The other formats are not so well defined and might be browser specific. JavaScript Date Output Independent of input format, JavaScript will (by default) output dates in full text string format: JavaScript ISO Dates ISO 8601 is the international standard for the representation of dates and times. The ISO 8601 syntax (YYYY-MM-DD) is also the preferred JavaScript date format: Example (Complete date) The computed date will be relative to your time zone.Depending on your time zone, the result above will vary between March 24 and March 25. ISO Dates (Year and Month) ISO dates can be written without specifying the day (YYYY-MM): Example Time zones will vary the result above between February 28 and March 01. ISO Dates (Only Year) ISO dates can be written without month and day (YYYY): Example Time zones will vary the result above between December 31 2014 and January 01 2015. ISO Dates (Date-Time) ISO dates can be written with added hours, minutes, and seconds (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ): Example Date and time is separated with a capital T. UTC time is defined with a capital letter Z. If you want to modify the time relative to UTC, remove the Z and add +HH:MM or -HH:MM instead: Example UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) is the same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). Omitting T or Z in a date-time string can give different results in different browsers. Time Zones When setting a date, without specifying the time zone, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone. When getting a date, without specifying the time zone, the result is converted to the browser's time zone. In other words: If a date/time is created in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), the date/time will be converted to CDT (Central US Daylight Time) if a user browses from central US. JavaScript Short Dates. Short dates are written with an \"MM/DD/YYYY\" syntax like this: Example WARNINGS ! In some browsers, months or days with no leading zeroes may produce an error: The behavior of \"YYYY/MM/DD\" is undefined.Some browsers will try to guess the format. Some will return NaN. The behavior of \"DD-MM-YYYY\" is also undefined.Some browsers will try to guess the format. Some will return NaN. JavaScript Long Dates.

Comparing Different Types Comparing data of different types may give unexpected results. When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when doing the comparison. An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric string converts to NaN which is always false. NaN false When comparing two strings, \"2\" will be greater than \"12\", because (alphabetically) 1 is less than 2. To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type before comparison: The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case. The default Keyword The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match: default Example The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6. getDay() If today is neither Saturday (6) nor Sunday (0), write a default message: The result of text will be:  The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block: default Example If default is not the last case in the switch block, remember to end the default case with a break. default Common Code Blocks Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code. In this example case 4 and 5 share the same code block, and 0 and 6 share another code block: Example Switching Details If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected. If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label. If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch. Strict Comparison Switch cases use strict comparison (===). The values must be of the same type to match. A strict comparison can only be true if the operands are of the same type. In this example there will be no match for x: Example"

    "document": "JavaScript For Loop Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. JavaScript Loops Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. Often this is the case when working with arrays: Instead of writing: You can write: Different Kinds of Loops JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: for for/in for/of while do/while The For Loop The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions: for Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block. Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. Example From the example above, you can read: Expression 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0). Expression 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). Expression 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed. How to use Expression 1 Expression 1 is used to initialize the variable(s) used in the loop (let i = 0). But, expression 1 is optional. You can omit expression 1 when your values are set before the loop starts: Example You can intiate many values in expression 1 (separated by comma): Example How to use Expression 2 Expression 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable (i < len). But, expression 2 is also optional. If expression 2 returns true, the loop will start over again. If it returns false, the loop will end. Note If you omit expression 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. Read about breaks in a later chapter of this tutorial. How to use Expression 3 Expression 3 increments the value of the initial variable (i++). But, expression 3 is also optional. Expression 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else. Expression 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop): Example Loop Scope Using var in a loop: var Example Using let in a loop: let Example In the first example, using var, the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable outside the loop. var In the second example, using let, the variable declared in the loop does not redeclare the variable outside the loop. let When let is used to declare the i variable in a loop, the i variable will only be visible within the loop. let For/Of and For/In Loops The for/in loop and the for/of loop are explained in the next chapter. for/in for/of While Loops The while loop and the do/while are explained in the next chapters. while do/while"

The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations. What Is a Regular Expression? A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for. A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern. Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Syntax Example Example explained: /w3schools/i is a regular expression. w3schools is a pattern (to be used in a search). i is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive). Using String Methods In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace(). search() replace() The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match. search() The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced. replace() Using String search() With a String The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match: search() Example Use a string to do a search for \"W3schools\" in a string: The result in n will be: 6 Try it Yourself » Using String search() With a Regular Expression Example Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for \"w3schools\" in a string: The result in n will be: 6 Try it Yourself » Using String replace() With a String The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string: replace() Use String replace() With a Regular Expression Example Use a case insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string: The result in res will be: Visit W3Schools!

When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur. Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things. Example In this example we misspelled \"alert\" as \"adddlert\" to deliberately produce an error: JavaScript catches adddlert as an error, and executes the catch code to handle it. JavaScript try and catch The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. try The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. catch The JavaScript statements try and catch come in pairs: try catch JavaScript Throws Errors When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: JavaScript will throw an exception (throw an error). JavaScript will actually create an Error object with two properties: name and message. The throw Statement The throw statement allows you to create a custom error. throw Technically you can throw an exception (throw an error). The exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object: String Number Boolean Object If you use throw together with try and catch, you can control program flow and generate custom error messages. throw try catch Input Validation Example This example examines input. If the value is wrong, an exception (err) is thrown. The exception (err) is caught by the catch statement and a custom error message is displayed: HTML Validation The code above is just an example. Modern browsers will often use a combination of JavaScript and built-in HTML validation, using predefined validation rules defined in HTML attributes: You can read more about forms validation in a later chapter of this tutorial. The finally Statement The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result: finally Syntax Example The Error Object JavaScript has a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. The error object provides two useful properties: name and message. Error Object Properties Error Name Values Six different values can be returned by the error name property: The six different values are described below. Eval Error An EvalError indicates an error in the eval() function. EvalError Newer versions of JavaScript do not throw EvalError. Use SyntaxError instead.

    "document": "JavaScript Scope Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope: Block Scope Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript variables had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. let const These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block: Example Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope. var Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block. Example Local Scope Variables declared within a JavaScript function, are LOCAL to the function: Example Local variables have Function Scope: They can only be accessed from within the function. Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed. Function Scope JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function. var let const They all have Function Scope: Global JavaScript Variables A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. Example A global variable has Global Scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. Global Scope Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. var let const They all have Global Scope: JavaScript Variables In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables. Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code. Automatically Global If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable. This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function. carName Example Strict Mode All modern browsers support running JavaScript in \"Strict Mode\". You will learn more about how to use strict mode in a later chapter of this tutorial. In \"Strict Mode\", undeclared variables are not automatically global. Global Variables in HTML With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment. In HTML, the global scope is the window object. Global variables defined with the var keyword belong to the window object: var Example Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object: let Example Warning Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to. Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions).Any function, including the window object, can overwrite your global variables and functions.

    "document": "JavaScript Use Strict \"use strict\"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in \"strict mode\". \"use strict\"; The \"use strict\" Directive The \"use strict\" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5. \"use strict\" It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript. The purpose of \"use strict\" is to indicate that the code should be executed in \"strict mode\". \"use strict\" With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables. All modern browsers support \"use strict\" except Internet Explorer 9 and lower: The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the directive. You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables. \"use strict\" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does not understand it. \"use strict\" Declaring Strict Mode Strict mode is declared by adding \"use strict\"; to the beginning of a script or a function. Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode): Example Example Declared inside a function, it has local scope (only the code inside the function is in strict mode): The \"use strict\"; Syntax The syntax, for declaring strict mode, was designed to be compatible with older versions of JavaScript. Compiling a numeric literal (4 + 5;) or a string literal (\"John Doe\";) in a JavaScript program has no side effects. It simply compiles to a non existing variable and dies. So \"use strict\"; only matters to new compilers that \"understand\" the meaning of it. \"use strict\"; Why Strict Mode? Strict mode makes it easier to write \"secure\" JavaScript. Strict mode changes previously accepted \"bad syntax\" into real errors. As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable. In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties. In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.

JSON Example This JSON syntax defines an employees object: an array of 3 employee records (objects): JSON Example The JSON Format Evaluates to JavaScript Objects The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects. JSON Syntax Rules JSON Data - A Name and a Value JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties. A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value: JSON names require double quotes. JavaScript names do not. JSON Objects JSON objects are written inside curly braces. Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs: JSON Arrays JSON arrays are written inside square brackets. Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects: In the example above, the object \"employees\" is an array. It contains three objects. Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name). Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page. For simplicity, this can be demonstrated using a string as input. First, create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax: Then, use the JavaScript built-in function JSON.parse() to convert the string into a JavaScript object: JSON.parse() Finally, use the new JavaScript object in your page: Example You can read more about JSON in our JSON tutorial."

Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors. Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging. JavaScript Debuggers Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger. Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing. Normally (otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page), you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select \"Console\" in the debugger menu. The console.log() Method If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window: console.log() Example Tip: Read more about the console.log() method in our JavaScript Console Reference. console.log() Setting Breakpoints In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

    "document": "JavaScript Style Guide Always use the same coding conventions for all your JavaScript projects. JavaScript Coding Conventions Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming. They typically cover: Coding conventions secure quality: Coding conventions can be documented rules for teams to follow, or just be your individual coding practice. This page describes the general JavaScript code conventions used by W3Schools. You should also read the next chapter \"Best Practices\", and learn how to avoid coding pitfalls. Variable Names At W3schools we use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions). All names start with a letter. At the bottom of this page, you will find a wider discussion about naming rules. Spaces Around Operators Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas: Examples: Code Indentation Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks: Functions: Do not use tabs (tabulators) for indentation. Different editors interpret tabs differently. Statement Rules General rules for simple statements: Examples: General rules for complex (compound) statements: Functions: Loops: Conditionals: Object Rules General rules for object definitions: Example Short objects can be written compressed, on one line, using spaces only between properties, like this: Line Length < 80 For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters. If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator or a comma. Example Naming Conventions Always use the same naming convention for all your code. For example: Should you use hyp-hens, camelCase, or under_scores in variable names? This is a question programmers often discuss. The answer depends on who you ask: Hyphens in HTML and CSS: HTML5 attributes can start with data- (data-quantity, data-price). CSS uses hyphens in property-names (font-size). Hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts. Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript names. Underscores: Many programmers prefer to use underscores (date_of_birth), especially in SQL databases. Underscores are often used in PHP documentation. PascalCase: PascalCase is often preferred by C programmers. camelCase: camelCase is used by JavaScript itself, by jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries. Do not start names with a $ sign. It will put you in conflict with many JavaScript library names. Loading JavaScript in HTML Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary): Accessing HTML Elements A consequence of using \"untidy\" HTML styles, might result in JavaScript errors. These two JavaScript statements will produce different results: If possible, use the same naming convention (as JavaScript) in HTML. Visit the HTML Style Guide. File Extensions HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed). CSS files should have a .css extension. JavaScript files should have a .js extension.

This will: This also goes for loop variables: Initialize Variables It is a good coding practice to initialize variables when you declare them. This will: Initializing variables provides an idea of the intended use (and intended data type). Declare Objects with const Declaring objects with const will prevent any accidental change of type: Example Declare Arrays with const Declaring arrays with const will prevent any accidential change of type: Example Don't Use new Object() \"\" new String() 0 new Number() false new Boolean() {} new Object() [] new Array() /()/ new RegExp() function (){} new Function() Example Beware of Automatic Type Conversions JavaScript is loosely typed. A variable can contain all data types. A variable can change its data type: Example Beware that numbers can accidentally be converted to strings or NaN (Not a Number). NaN When doing mathematical operations, JavaScript can convert numbers to strings: Example Subtracting a string from a string, does not generate an error but returns NaN (Not a Number): NaN Example Use === Comparison The == comparison operator always converts (to matching types) before comparison. == The === operator forces comparison of values and type: === Example Use Parameter Defaults If a function is called with a missing argument, the value of the missing argument is set to undefined. undefined Undefined values can break your code. It is a good habit to assign default values to arguments. Example ECMAScript 2015 allows default parameters in the function definition: function (a=1, b=1) { /*function code*/ } Read more about function parameters and arguments at Function Parameters End Your Switches with Defaults Always end your switch statements with a default. Even if you think there is no need for it. switch default Example Avoid Number, String, and Boolean as Objects Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects. Declaring these types as objects, slows down execution speed, and produces nasty side effects: Example Or even worse: Example Avoid Using eval() The eval() function is used to run text as code. In almost all cases, it should not be necessary to use it. eval() Because it allows arbitrary code to be run, it also represents a security problem."

    "document": "JavaScript Common Mistakes This chapter points out some common JavaScript mistakes. Accidentally Using the Assignment Operator JavaScript programs may generate unexpected results if a programmer accidentally uses an assignment operator (=), instead of a comparison operator (==) in an if statement. = == This if statement returns false (as expected) because x is not equal to 10: if false This if statement returns true (maybe not as expected), because 10 is true: if true This if statement returns false (maybe not as expected), because 0 is false: if false An assignment always returns the value of the assignment. Expecting Loose Comparison In regular comparison, data type does not matter. This if statement returns true: if In strict comparison, data type does matter. This if statement returns false: if It is a common mistake to forget that switch statements use strict comparison: switch This case switch will display an alert: case switch This case switch will not display an alert: case switch Confusing Addition & Concatenation Addition is about adding numbers. Concatenation is about adding strings. In JavaScript both operations use the same + operator. + Because of this, adding a number as a number will produce a different result from adding a number as a string: When adding two variables, it can be difficult to anticipate the result: Misunderstanding Floats All numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64-bits Floating point numbers (Floats). All programming languages, including JavaScript, have difficulties with precise floating point values: To solve the problem above, it helps to multiply and divide: Example Breaking a JavaScript String JavaScript will allow you to break a statement into two lines: Example 1 But, breaking a statement in the middle of a string will not work: Example 2 You must use a \"backslash\" if you must break a statement in a string: Example 3 Misplacing Semicolon Because of a misplaced semicolon, this code block will execute regardless of the value of x: Breaking a Return Statement It is a default JavaScript behavior to close a statement automatically at the end of a line. Because of this, these two examples will return the same result: Example 1 Example 2 JavaScript will also allow you to break a statement into two lines. Because of this, example 3 will also return the same result: Example 3 But, what will happen if you break the return statement in two lines like this: Example 4 The function will return undefined! undefined Why? Because JavaScript thought you meant: Example 5 Explanation If a statement is incomplete like: JavaScript will try to complete the statement by reading the next line: But since this statement is complete: JavaScript will automatically close it like this: This happens because closing (ending) statements with semicolon is optional in JavaScript. JavaScript will close the return statement at the end of the line, because it is a complete statement. Never break a return statement. Accessing Arrays with Named Indexes Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes."

    "document": "Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes). JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes. In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes: Example In JavaScript, objects use named indexes. If you use a named index, when accessing an array, JavaScript will redefine the array to a standard object. After the automatic redefinition, array methods and properties will produce undefined or incorrect results: Example: Ending Definitions with a Comma Trailing commas in object and array definition are legal in ECMAScript 5. Object Example: Array Example: WARNING ! ! Internet Explorer 8 will crash. JSON does not allow trailing commas.

Each statement in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for each iteration of the loop. Statements or assignments that can be placed outside the loop will make the loop run faster. Bad: Better Code: The bad code accesses the length property of an array each time the loop is iterated. The better code accesses the length property outside the loop and makes the loop run faster. Reduce DOM Access Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements. If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable: Example Reduce DOM Size Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small. This will always improve page loading, and speed up rendering (page display), especially on smaller devices. Every attempt to search the DOM (like getElementsByTagName) will benefit from a smaller DOM. Avoid Unnecessary Variables Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save values. Often you can replace code like this: With this: Delay JavaScript Loading Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first. While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. In addition all parsing and rendering activity might be blocked. The HTTP specification defines that browsers should not download more than two components in parallel. An alternative is to use defer=\"true\" in the script tag. The defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts. defer=\"true\" If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page has loaded: Example Avoid Using with Avoid using the with keyword.

JavaScript let The let keyword allows you to declare a variable with block scope. let Example Read more about let in the chapter: JavaScript Let. let JavaScript const The const keyword allows you to declare a constant (a JavaScript variable with a constant value). const Constants are similar to let variables, except that the value cannot be changed. Example Read more about const in the chapter: JavaScript Const. const Arrow Functions Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions. You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets. function return Example Arrow functions do not have their own this. They are not well suited for defining object methods. this Arrow functions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are used. Using const is safer than using var, because a function expression is always a constant value. const var You can only omit the return keyword and the curly brackets if the function is a single statement. Because of this, it might be a good habit to always keep them: return Example Learn more about Arrow Functions in the chapter: JavaScript Arrow Function. Object Destructuring Destructuring assignment makes it easy to assign array values and object properties to variables. Example Note: When destructuring an object, you must use the same name for the variables as the corresponding object keys (names). The order of the keys (names) does not matter. Array Destructuring Destructuring assignment makes it easy to assign array values and object properties to variables. Example The Spread (...) Operator The ... operator expands an iterable (like an array) into more elements: Example const q1 = [\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\"]; const q2 = [\"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\"]; const q3 = [\"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\"]; const q4 = [\"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"May\"]; const year = [...q1, ...q2, ...q3, ...q4]; Try it Yourself » The ... operator can be used to expand an iterable into more arguments for function calls: Example const numbers = [23,55,21,87,56]; let maxValue = Math.max(...numbers); Try it Yourself » The For/Of Loop The JavaScript for/of statement loops through the values of an iterable objects. for/of lets you loop over data structures that are iterable such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more.

    "document": "JavaScript History JavaScript / ECMAScript JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5). Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1). Note * Internet Explorer 9 did not support ES5 \"use strict\". ** Internet Explorer 11 does not support ES6. The ECMA Technical Committee 39 In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language. ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997. From ES4 to ES6 When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps: The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp: Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3. The ECMAScript 4 Camp: Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade. August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email: It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over. The solution was to work together: ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5 ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3. Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions. TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5. The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed \"Harmony\" (Because of the split it created?). ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully compliant by July 2013: Chrome 23 IE10 / Edge Firefox 21 Safari 6 Opera 15 Nov 2012 Sep 2012 May 2013 Jul 2012 Jul 2013 ES6 was also a huge success.

    "document": "JavaScript Function Definitions JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword. function You can use a function declaration or a function expression. Function Declarations Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions are declared with the following syntax: Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are \"saved for later use\", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon). Example Semicolons are used to separate executable JavaScript statements. Since a function declaration is not an executable statement, it is not common to end it with a semicolon. Function Expressions A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression. A function expression can be stored in a variable: Example After a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as a function: Example The function above is actually an anonymous function (a function without a name). Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name. The function above ends with a semicolon because it is a part of an executable statement. The Function() Constructor As you have seen in the previous examples, JavaScript functions are defined with the function keyword. function Functions can also be defined with a built-in JavaScript function constructor called Function(). Function() Example You actually don't have to use the function constructor. The example above is the same as writing: Example Most of the time, you can avoid using the new keyword in JavaScript. new Function Hoisting Earlier in this tutorial, you learned about \"hoisting\" (JavaScript Hoisting). Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope. Hoisting applies to variable declarations and to function declarations. Because of this, JavaScript functions can be called before they are declared: Functions defined using an expression are not hoisted. Self-Invoking Functions Function expressions can be made \"self-invoking\". A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called. Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by (). You cannot self-invoke a function declaration. You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it is a function expression: Example The function above is actually an anonymous self-invoking function (function without name). Functions Can Be Used as Values JavaScript functions can be used as values: Example JavaScript functions can be used in expressions: Example Functions are Objects The typeof operator in JavaScript returns \"function\" for functions. typeof But, JavaScript functions can best be described as objects. JavaScript functions have both properties and methods. The arguments.length property returns the number of arguments received when the function was invoked: arguments.length Example The toString() method returns the function as a string: toString() Example A function defined as the property of an object, is called a method to the object. A function designed to create new objects, is called an object constructor. Arrow Functions Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions. You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets."

    "document": "JavaScript Function Parameters A JavaScript function does not perform any checking on parameter values (arguments). function Function Parameters and Arguments Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions can have parameters: Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function. Parameter Rules JavaScript function definitions do not specify data types for parameters. JavaScript functions do not perform type checking on the passed arguments. JavaScript functions do not check the number of arguments received. Default Parameters If a function is called with missing arguments (less than declared), the missing values are set to undefined. undefined Sometimes this is acceptable, but sometimes it is better to assign a default value to the parameter: Example Default Parameter Values ES6 allows function parameters to have default values. Example If y is not passed or undefined, then y = 10. Function Rest Parameter The rest parameter (...) allows a function to treat an indefinite number of arguments as an array: Example The Arguments Object JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked). This way you can simply use a function to find (for instance) the highest value in a list of numbers: Example Or create a function to sum all input values: Example If a function is called with too many arguments (more than declared), these arguments can be reached using the arguments object. Arguments are Passed by Value The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value. Changes to arguments are not visible (reflected) outside the function. Objects are Passed by Reference In JavaScript, object references are values. Because of this, objects will behave like they are passed by reference: If a function changes an object property, it changes the original value. Changes to object properties are visible (reflected) outside the function."

The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked. It is common to use the term \"call a function\" instead of \"invoke a function\". It is also common to say \"call upon a function\", \"start a function\", or \"execute a function\". In this tutorial, we will use invoke, because a JavaScript function can be invoked without being called. Invoking a Function as a Function Example The function above does not belong to any object. But in JavaScript there is always a default global object. In HTML the default global object is the HTML page itself, so the function above \"belongs\" to the HTML page. In a browser the page object is the browser window. The function above automatically becomes a window function. Note This is a common way to invoke a JavaScript function, but not a very good practice. Global variables, methods, or functions can easily create name conflicts and bugs in the global object. myFunction() and window.myFunction() is the same function: Example What is this? In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object. this The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used: this this this this this undefined this call() apply() bind() this Note this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this. this this See Also: The JavaScript this Tutorial The Global Object When a function is called without an owner object, the value of this becomes the global object. this In a web browser the global object is the browser window. This example returns the window object as the value of this: this Example Invoking a function as a global function, causes the value of this to be the global object. Using the window object as a variable can easily crash your program. Invoking a Function as a Method In JavaScript you can define functions as object methods. The following example creates an object (myObject), with two properties (firstName and lastName), and a method (fullName): Example The fullName method is a function. The function belongs to the object. myObject is the owner of the function. The thing called this, is the object that \"owns\" the JavaScript code. In this case the value of this is myObject. this this Test it! Change the fullName method to return the value of this: this Example Invoking a function as an object method, causes the value of this to be the object itself. this Invoking a Function with the Constructor If a function invocation is preceded with the new keyword, it is a constructor invocation. new It looks like you create a new function, but since JavaScript functions are objects you actually create a new object: Example A constructor invocation creates a new object."

A function can access all variables in the local scope. function Example a is a local variable defined inside the function: Global Variables A global variable is a \"public\" variable defined outside a function. A function can access all variables in the global scope: function Example a is global variable defined outside the function: In a web page, global variables belong to the page. Global variables can be used (or changed) by all scripts in the page. A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is private and hidden from other functions and other scripting code. Global and local variables with the same name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other. Note Undeclared variables (created without a keyword var, let, const), are always global, even if they are created inside a function. var let const Example The variable a is a global variable because it is undeclared: Variable Lifetime Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate to another page or close the window. Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished. A Counter Dilemma Suppose you want to use a variable for counting something, and you want this counter to be available to everyone (all functions). You could use a global variable, and a function to increase the counter: function Example Warning ! There is a problem with the solution above: Any code on the page can change the counter, without calling add(). The counter should be local to the add() function, to prevent other code from changing it: add() Example It did not work because we display the global counter instead of the local counter. We can remove the global counter and access the local counter by letting the function return it: Example It did not work because we reset the local counter every time we call the function. Solution A JavaScript inner function can solve this. JavaScript Nested Functions All functions have access to the global scope. In fact, in JavaScript, all functions have access to the scope \"above\" them. JavaScript supports nested functions. Nested functions have access to the scope \"above\" them. Example The inner function plus() has access to the counter variable in the parent function: plus() counter This could have solved the counter dilemma, if we could reach the plus() function from the outside. plus() We also need to find a way to execute counter = 0 only once. counter = 0 Solution We need a closure.

Conclusion A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, after the parent function has closed. Closures has historically been used to: Note Old JavaScript code will often contain closures, but modern JavaScript will not use closures as frequently as before.

You can add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e two \"click\" events. You can add event listeners to any DOM object not only HTML elements. i.e the window object. The addEventListener() method makes it easier to control how the event reacts to bubbling. addEventListener() When using the addEventListener() method, the JavaScript is separated from the HTML markup, for better readability and allows you to add event listeners even when you do not control the HTML markup. addEventListener() You can easily remove an event listener by using the removeEventListener() method. removeEventListener() Syntax The first parameter is the type of the event (like \"click\" or \"mousedown\" or any other HTML DOM Event.) click mousedown The second parameter is the function we want to call when the event occurs. The third parameter is a boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing. This parameter is optional. Note that you don't use the \"on\" prefix for the event; use \"click\" instead of \"onclick\". click onclick Add an Event Handler to an Element Example Alert \"Hello World!\" when the user clicks on an element: You can also refer to an external \"named\" function: Example Alert \"Hello World!\" when the user clicks on an element: Add Many Event Handlers to the Same Element The addEventListener() method allows you to add many events to the same element, without overwriting existing events: addEventListener() Example You can add events of different types to the same element: Example Add an Event Handler to the window Object The addEventListener() method allows you to add event listeners on any HTML DOM object such as HTML elements, the HTML document, the window object, or other objects that support events, like the xmlHttpRequest object. addEventListener() xmlHttpRequest Example Add an event listener that fires when a user resizes the window: Passing Parameters When passing parameter values, use an \"anonymous function\" that calls the specified function with the parameters: Example Event Bubbling or Event Capturing? There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM, bubbling and capturing. Event propagation is a way of defining the element order when an event occurs. If you have a <p> element inside a <div> element, and the user clicks on the <p> element, which element's \"click\" event should be handled first? In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer: the <p> element's click event is handled first, then the <div> element's click event.

When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished. A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser versions that fully support Web Workers: Web Workers Example The example below creates a simple web worker that count numbers in the background: Example Start Worker Stop Worker Check Web Worker Support Before creating a web worker, check whether the user's browser supports it: Create a Web Worker File Now, let's create our web worker in an external JavaScript. Here, we create a script that counts. The script is stored in the \"demo_workers.js\" file: The important part of the code above is the postMessage() method - which is used to post a message back to the HTML page. postMessage() Note: Normally web workers are not used for such simple scripts, but for more CPU intensive tasks. Create a Web Worker Object Now that we have the web worker file, we need to call it from an HTML page. The following lines checks if the worker already exists, if not - it creates a new web worker object and runs the code in \"demo_workers.js\": Then we can send and receive messages from the web worker. Add an \"onmessage\" event listener to the web worker. When the web worker posts a message, the code within the event listener is executed. The data from the web worker is stored in event.data. Terminate a Web Worker When a web worker object is created, it will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. To terminate a web worker, and free browser/computer resources, use the terminate() method: terminate() Reuse the Web Worker If you set the worker variable to undefined, after it has been terminated, you can reuse the code: Full Web Worker Example Code We have already seen the Worker code in the .js file.

XMLHttpRequest The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. XMLHttpRequest Create an XMLHttpRequest Object All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Edge, Safari, Opera) have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object. XMLHttpRequest Syntax for creating an XMLHttpRequest object: XMLHttpRequest Define a Callback Function A callback function is a function passed as a parameter to another function. In this case, the callback function should contain the code to execute when the response is ready. Send a Request To send a request to a server, you can use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object: XMLHttpRequest Example Access Across Domains For security reasons, modern browsers do not allow access across domains. This means that both the web page and the XML file it tries to load, must be located on the same server. The examples on W3Schools all open XML files located on the W3Schools domain. If you want to use the example above on one of your own web pages, the XML files you load must be located on your own server. XMLHttpRequest Object Methods XMLHttpRequest Object Properties The onload Property With the XMLHttpRequest object you can define a callback function to be executed when the request receives an answer. XMLHttpRequest The function is defined in the onload property of the XMLHttpRequest object: onload XMLHttpRequest Example Multiple Callback Functions If you have more than one AJAX task in a website, you should create one function for executing the XMLHttpRequest object, and one callback function for each AJAX task. XMLHttpRequest The function call should contain the URL and what function to call when the response is ready. Example The onreadystatechange Property The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest. readyState The onreadystatechange property defines a callback function to be executed when the readyState changes. onreadystatechange The status property and the statusText properties hold the status of the XMLHttpRequest object. status statusText The onreadystatechange function is called every time the readyState changes. onreadystatechange When readyState is 4 and status is 200, the response is ready: readyState Example The onreadystatechange event is triggered four times (1-4), one time for each change in the readyState. onreadystatechange"

Send a Request To a Server To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object: XMLHttpRequest The url - A File On a Server The url parameter of the open() method, is an address to a file on a server: open() The file can be any kind of file, like .txt and .xml, or server scripting files like .asp and .php (which can perform actions on the server before sending the response back). Asynchronous - True or False? Server requests should be sent asynchronously. The async parameter of the open() method should be set to true: By sending asynchronously, the JavaScript does not have to wait for the server response, but can instead: The default value for the async parameter is async = true. You can safely remove the third parameter from your code. Synchronous XMLHttpRequest (async = false) is not recommended because the JavaScript will stop executing until the server response is ready. If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop. GET or POST? GET is simpler and faster than POST, and can be used in most cases. GET POST However, always use POST requests when: GET Requests A simple GET request: GET Example In the example above, you may get a cached result. To avoid this, add a unique ID to the URL: Example If you want to send information with the GET method, add the information to the URL: GET Example How the server uses the input and how the server responds to a request, is explained in a later chapter. POST Requests A simple POST request: POST Example To POST data like an HTML form, add an HTTP header with setRequestHeader(). Specify the data you want to send in the send() method: setRequestHeader() send() Example Synchronous Request To execute a synchronous request, change the third parameter in the open() method to false: open() false Sometimes async = false are used for quick testing. You will also find synchronous requests in older JavaScript code. Since the code will wait for server completion, there is no need for an onreadystatechange function: onreadystatechange Example Synchronous XMLHttpRequest (async = false) is not recommended because the JavaScript will stop executing until the server response is ready. If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop. Modern developer tools are encouraged to warn about using synchronous requests and may throw an InvalidAccessError exception when it occurs."

Code for reading and generating JSON exists in many programming languages. The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford. Why Use JSON? The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects. Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language. JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects: JSON.parse() JSON.parse() JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string: JSON.stringify() JSON.stringify() You can receive pure text from a server and use it as a JavaScript object. You can send a JavaScript object to a server in pure text format. You can work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

XMLHttpRequest JSONP uses the <script> tag instead. <script> JSONP Intro JSONP stands for JSON with Padding. Requesting a file from another domain can cause problems, due to cross-domain policy. Requesting an external script from another domain does not have this problem. JSONP uses this advantage, and request files using the script tag instead of the XMLHttpRequest object. XMLHttpRequest The Server File The file on the server wraps the result inside a function call: Example The result returns a call to a function named \"myFunc\" with the JSON data as a parameter. Make sure that the function exists on the client. The JavaScript function The function named \"myFunc\" is located on the client, and ready to handle JSON data: Example Creating a Dynamic Script Tag The example above will execute the \"myFunc\" function when the page is loading, based on where you put the script tag, which is not very satisfying. The script tag should only be created when needed: Example Create and insert the <script> tag when a button is clicked: Dynamic JSONP Result The examples above are still very static. Make the example dynamic by sending JSON to the php file, and let the php file return a JSON object based on the information it gets. PHP file PHP File explained: JavaScript Example The \"myFunc\" function will be called from the php file: Callback Function When you have no control over the server file, how do you get the server file to call the correct function? Sometimes the server file offers a callback function as a parameter: Example The php file will call the function you pass as a callback parameter:"

RDBMS is the basis for all modern database systems such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Microsoft Access. RDBMS uses SQL queries to access the data in the database. What is a Database Table? A table is a collection of related data entries, and it consists of columns and rows. A column holds specific information about every record in the table. A record (or row) is each individual entry that exists in a table. Look at a selection from the Northwind \"Customers\" table: The columns in the \"Customers\" table above are: CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. The table has 5 records (rows). What is a Relational Database? A relational database defines database relationships in the form of tables. The tables are related to each other - based on data common to each. Look at the following three tables \"Customers\", \"Orders\", and \"Shippers\" from the Northwind database: Customers Table The relationship between the \"Customers\" table and the \"Orders\" table is the CustomerID column: Orders Table The relationship between the \"Orders\" table and the \"Shippers\" table is the ShipperID column: Shippers Table"

Create Constraints Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement. CREATE TABLE ALTER TABLE Syntax MySQL Constraints SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted. Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table. The following constraints are commonly used in SQL: NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL UNIQUE FOREIGN KEY CHECK DEFAULT CREATE INDEX"

So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against. CREATE INDEX Syntax Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX Syntax Creates a unique index on a table. Duplicate values are not allowed: MySQL CREATE INDEX Example The SQL statement below creates an index named \"idx_lastname\" on the \"LastName\" column in the \"Persons\" table: If you want to create an index on a combination of columns, you can list the column names within the parentheses, separated by commas: DROP INDEX Statement The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.

As long as your data contains only the date portion, your queries will work as expected. However, if a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated. MySQL Date Data Types MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database: DATE DATETIME TIMESTAMP YEAR Note: The date data type are set for a column when you create a new table in your database! Working with Dates Look at the following table: Orders Table Now we want to select the records with an OrderDate of \"2008-11-11\" from the table above. We use the following SELECT statement: SELECT The result-set will look like this: Note: Two dates can easily be compared if there is no time component involved! Now, assume that the \"Orders\" table looks like this (notice the added time-component in the \"OrderDate\" column): If we use the same SELECT statement as above: SELECT we will get no result! This is because the query is looking only for dates with no time portion. Tip: To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not use time-components in your dates, unless you have to!"

MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0) Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type. An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data. In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time. String Data Types Numeric Data Types Note: All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the UNSIGNED attribute to the column.

Example Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0): Looping Through a String Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop. for Example Loop through the letters in the word \"banana\": Learn more about For Loops in our Python For Loops chapter. String Length To get the length of a string, use the len() function. len() Example The len() function returns the length of a string: len() Check String To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in. in Example Check if \"free\" is present in the following text: Use it in an if statement: if Example Print only if \"free\" is present: Learn more about If statements in our Python If...Else chapter. Check if NOT To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in. not in Example Check if \"expensive\" is NOT present in the following text: Use it in an if statement: if Example print only if \"expensive\" is NOT present:"

    "document": "Python If ... Else Python Conditions and If statements Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in \"if statements\" and loops. An \"if statement\" is written by using the if keyword. Example If statement: In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that \"b is greater than a\". Indentation Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. Example If statement, without indentation (will raise an error): a = 33 b = 200 if b > a: print(\"b is greater than a\") # you will get an error Try it Yourself » Elif The elif keyword is Python's way of saying \"if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition\".

Else The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

    "document": "Python Functions A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. Creating a Function In Python a function is defined using the def keyword: Example Calling a Function To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis: Example Arguments Information can be passed into functions as arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma. The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name: Example Arguments are often shortened to args in Python documentations. Parameters or Arguments? The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function. From a function's perspective: A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called. Number of Arguments By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less. Example This function expects 2 arguments, and gets 2 arguments: Example This function expects 2 arguments, but gets only 1: Arbitrary Arguments, *args If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition. * This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly: Example If the number of arguments is unknown, add a * before the parameter name: * Arbitrary Arguments are often shortened to *args in Python documentations. Keyword Arguments You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax. This way the order of the arguments does not matter. Example The phrase Keyword Arguments are often shortened to kwargs in Python documentations.

Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result. The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming. In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself (\"recurse\"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0). To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it. Example Recursion Example"

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function. __init__() All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated. __init__() Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created: __init__() Example Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age: __init__() Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object. __init__() The __str__() Function The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string. __str__() If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned: __str__() Example The string representation of an object WITHOUT the __str__() function: __str__() Example The string representation of an object WITH the __str__() function: __str__() Object Methods Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist \"r\" \"a\" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist \"a\" \"w\" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist \"w\" \"x\" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists \"x\" In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode \"t\" - Text - Default value. Text mode \"t\" \"b\" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images) \"b\" Syntax To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file: The code above is the same as: Because \"r\" for read, and \"t\" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them. \"r\" \"t\" Note: Make sure the file exists, or else you will get an error."

    "document": "Matplotlib Plotting Plotting x and y points The plot() function is used to draw points (markers) in a diagram. plot() By default, the plot() function draws a line from point to point. plot() The function takes parameters for specifying points in the diagram. Parameter 1 is an array containing the points on the x-axis. Parameter 2 is an array containing the points on the y-axis. If we need to plot a line from (1, 3) to (8, 10), we have to pass two arrays [1, 8] and [3, 10] to the plot function. Example Draw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to position (8, 10): Result:  The x-axis is the horizontal axis. The y-axis is the vertical axis. Plotting Without Line To plot only the markers, you can use shortcut string notation parameter 'o', which means 'rings'. Example Draw two points in the diagram, one at position (1, 3) and one in position (8, 10): Result:  You will learn more about markers in the next chapter. Multiple Points You can plot as many points as you like, just make sure you have the same number of points in both axis. Example Draw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to (2, 8) then to (6, 1) and finally to position (8, 10): Result:  Default X-Points If we do not specify the points on the x-axis, they will get the default values 0, 1, 2, 3 etc., depending on the length of the y-points. So, if we take the same example as above, and leave out the x-points, the diagram will look like this: Example Plotting without x-points: Result:  The x-points in the example above are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]."

    "document": "Machine Learning Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics. Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome. Where To Start? In this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets. We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need. And we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned. Data Set In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database. Example of an array: [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86] [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86] Example of a database: By looking at the array, we can guess that the average value is probably around 80 or 90, and we are also able to determine the highest value and the lowest value, but what else can we do? And by looking at the database we can see that the most popular color is white, and the oldest car is 17 years, but what if we could predict if a car had an AutoPass, just by looking at the other values? That is what Machine Learning is for! Analyzing data and predicting the outcome! In Machine Learning it is common to work with very large data sets. In this tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the different concepts of machine learning, and we will work with small easy-to-understand data sets. Data Types To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with. We can split the data types into three main categories: Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories: Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values. Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on. By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them. You will learn more about statistics and analyzing data in the next chapters."

In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us: Example: We have registered the speed of 13 cars: speed = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86] speed = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86] What is the average, the middle, or the most common speed value? Mean The mean value is the average value. To calculate the mean, find the sum of all values, and divide the sum by the number of values: (99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77 (99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77 The NumPy module has a method for this. Learn about the NumPy module in our NumPy Tutorial. Example Use the NumPy mean() method to find the average speed: mean() Median The median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values: 77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 88, 94, 99, 103, 111 77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87 , 87, 88, 94, 99, 103, 111 It is important that the numbers are sorted before you can find the median. The NumPy module has a method for this: Example Use the NumPy median() method to find the middle value: median() If there are two numbers in the middle, divide the sum of those numbers by two. 77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 94, 98, 99, 103 (86 + 87) / 2 = 86.5 77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87 , 87, 94, 98, 99, 103 (86 + 87) / 2 = 86.5 Example Using the NumPy module: Mode The Mode value is the value that appears the most number of times: 99,86, 87, 88, 111,86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85,86 = 86 99, 86 , 87, 88, 111, 86 , 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86 = 86 The SciPy module has a method for this.

    "document": "Machine Learning - Standard Deviation What is Standard Deviation? Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are. A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value. A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range. Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars: speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86] speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86] The standard deviation is: 0.9 0.9 Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean value, which is 86.4. Let us do the same with a selection of numbers with a wider range: speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97] speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97] The standard deviation is: 37.85 37.85 Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 37.85 from the mean value, which is 77.4. As you can see, a higher standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

In fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard deviation! Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance! To calculate the variance you have to do as follows: 1. Find the mean: (32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.4 (32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.4 2.

In the real world, the data sets are much bigger, but it can be difficult to gather real world data, at least at an early stage of a project. How Can we Get Big Data Sets? To create big data sets for testing, we use the Python module NumPy, which comes with a number of methods to create random data sets, of any size. Example Create an array containing 250 random floats between 0 and 5: Histogram To visualize the data set we can draw a histogram with the data we collected. We will use the Python module Matplotlib to draw a histogram. Learn about the Matplotlib module in our Matplotlib Tutorial. Example Draw a histogram: Result:  Histogram Explained We use the array from the example above to draw a histogram with 5 bars. The first bar represents how many values in the array are between 0 and 1. The second bar represents how many values are between 1 and 2. Etc. Which gives us this result: Note: The array values are random numbers and will not show the exact same result on your computer. Big Data Distributions An array containing 250 values is not considered very big, but now you know how to create a random set of values, and by changing the parameters, you can create the data set as big as you want.

In this chapter we will learn how to create an array where the values are concentrated around a given value. In probability theory this kind of data distribution is known as the normal data distribution, or the Gaussian data distribution, after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss who came up with the formula of this data distribution. Example A typical normal data distribution: Result:  Note: A normal distribution graph is also known as the bell curve because of it's characteristic shape of a bell. Histogram Explained We use the array from the numpy.random.normal() method, with 100000 values, to draw a histogram with 100 bars. numpy.random.normal() We specify that the mean value is 5.0, and the standard deviation is 1.0. Meaning that the values should be concentrated around 5.0, and rarely further away than 1.0 from the mean. And as you can see from the histogram, most values are between 4.0 and 6.0, with a top at approximately 5.0."

Note: It seems that the newer the car, the faster it drives, but that could be a coincidence, after all we only registered 13 cars. Random Data Distributions In Machine Learning the data sets can contain thousands-, or even millions, of values. You might not have real world data when you are testing an algorithm, you might have to use randomly generated values. As we have learned in the previous chapter, the NumPy module can help us with that! Let us create two arrays that are both filled with 1000 random numbers from a normal data distribution. The first array will have the mean set to 5.0 with a standard deviation of 1.0. The second array will have the mean set to 10.0 with a standard deviation of 2.0: Example A scatter plot with 1000 dots: Result:  Scatter Plot Explained We can see that the dots are concentrated around the value 5 on the x-axis, and 10 on the y-axis. We can also see that the spread is wider on the y-axis than on the x-axis."

    "document": "Machine Learning - Linear Regression Regression The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables. In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events. Linear Regression Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them. This line can be used to predict future values. In Machine Learning, predicting the future is very important. How Does it Work? Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression. We will show you how to use these methods instead of going through the mathematic formula. In the example below, the x-axis represents age, and the y-axis represents speed.

This new value represents where on the y-axis the corresponding x value will be placed: slope intercept def myfunc(x): return slope * x + intercept def myfunc(x): return slope * x + intercept Run each value of the x array through the function. This will result in a new array with new values for the y-axis: mymodel = list(map(myfunc, x)) mymodel = list(map(myfunc, x)) Draw the original scatter plot: plt.scatter(x, y) plt.scatter(x, y) Draw the line of linear regression: plt.plot(x, mymodel) plt.plot(x, mymodel) Display the diagram: plt.show() plt.show() R for Relationship It is important to know how the relationship between the values of the x-axis and the values of the y-axis is, if there are no relationship the linear regression can not be used to predict anything. This relationship - the coefficient of correlation - is called r. r The r value ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 (and -1) means 100% related. r Python and the Scipy module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y values.

    "document": "Machine Learning - Multiple Regression Multiple Regression Multiple regression is like linear regression, but with more than one independent value, meaning that we try to predict a value based on two or more variables. Take a look at the data set below, it contains some information about cars. We can predict the CO2 emission of a car based on the size of the engine, but with multiple regression we can throw in more variables, like the weight of the car, to make the prediction more accurate. How Does it Work? In Python we have modules that will do the work for us. Start by importing the Pandas module. import pandas import pandas Learn about the Pandas module in our Pandas Tutorial. The Pandas module allows us to read csv files and return a DataFrame object. The file is meant for testing purposes only, you can download it here: data.csv df = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\") df = pandas.read_csv(\"data.csv\") Then make a list of the independent values and call this variable X. X Put the dependent values in a variable called y. y X = df[['Weight', 'Volume']] y = df['CO2'] X = df[['Weight', 'Volume']] y = df['CO2'] Tip: It is common to name the list of independent values with a upper case X, and the list of dependent values with a lower case y. We will use some methods from the sklearn module, so we will have to import that module as well: from sklearn import linear_model from sklearn import linear_model From the sklearn module we will use the LinearRegression() method to create a linear regression object. LinearRegression() This object has a method called fit() that takes the independent and dependent values as parameters and fills the regression object with data that describes the relationship: fit() regr = linear_model.LinearRegression() regr.fit(X, y) regr = linear_model.LinearRegression() regr.fit(X, y) Now we have a regression object that are ready to predict CO2 values based on a car's weight and volume: #predict the CO2 emission of a car where the weight is 2300kg, and the volume is 1300cm3: predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[2300, 1300]]) #predict the CO2 emission of a car where the weight is 2300kg, and the volume is 1300cm3: predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[2300, 1300]]) Example See the whole example in action: Result: [107.2087328] Run example » We have predicted that a car with 1.3 liter engine, and a weight of 2300 kg, will release approximately 107 grams of CO2 for every kilometer it drives. Coefficient The coefficient is a factor that describes the relationship with an unknown variable. Example: if x is a variable, then 2x is x two times. x is the unknown variable, and the number 2 is the coefficient. x 2x x x 2 In this case, we can ask for the coefficient value of weight against CO2, and for volume against CO2. The answer(s) we get tells us what would happen if we increase, or decrease, one of the independent values."

And if the engine size (Volume) increases by 1cm3, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00780526g. I think that is a fair guess, but let test it! We have already predicted that if a car with a 1300cm3 engine weighs 2300kg, the CO2 emission will be approximately 107g. What if we increase the weight with 1000kg? Example Copy the example from before, but change the weight from 2300 to 3300: Result: [114.75968007] Run example » We have predicted that a car with 1.3 liter engine, and a weight of 3300 kg, will release approximately 115 grams of CO2 for every kilometer it drives.

    "document": "Machine Learning - Scale Scale Features When your data has different values, and even different measurement units, it can be difficult to compare them. What is kilograms compared to meters? Or altitude compared to time? The answer to this problem is scaling. We can scale data into new values that are easier to compare. Take a look at the table below, it is the same data set that we used in the multiple regression chapter, but this time the volume column contains values in liters instead of cm3 (1.0 instead of 1000). It can be difficult to compare the volume 1.0 with the weight 790, but if we scale them both into comparable values, we can easily see how much one value is compared to the other. There are different methods for scaling data, in this tutorial we will use a method called standardization. The standardization method uses this formula: z = (x - u) / s z = (x - u) / s Where z is the new value, x is the original value, u is the mean and s is the standard deviation. z x u s If you take the weight column from the data set above, the first value is 790, and the scaled value will be: (790 - 1292.23) / 238.74 = -2.1 If you take the volume column from the data set above, the first value is 1.0, and the scaled value will be: (1.0 - 1.61) / 0.38 = -1.59 (1.0 - 1.61) / 0.38 = -1.59 Now you can compare -2.1 with -1.59 instead of comparing 790 with 1.0. You do not have to do this manually, the Python sklearn module has a method called StandardScaler() which returns a Scaler object with methods for transforming data sets. StandardScaler() Example Scale all values in the Weight and Volume columns: Result: Note that the first two values are -2.1 and -1.59, which corresponds to our calculations: [[-2.10389253 -1.59336644] [-0.55407235 -1.07190106] [-1.52166278 -1.59336644] [-1.78973979 -1.85409913] [-0.63784641 -0.28970299] [-1.52166278 -1.59336644] [-0.76769621 -0.55043568] [ 0.3046118 -0.28970299] [-0.7551301 -0.28970299] [-0.59595938 -0.0289703 ] [-1.30803892 -1.33263375] [-1.26615189 -0.81116837] [-0.7551301 -1.59336644] [-0.16871166 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.14125238 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.15800719 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.3046118 -0.0289703 ] [-0.05142797 1.53542584] [-0.72580918 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.14962979 1.01396046] [ 1.2219378 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.5685001 1.01396046] [ 0.3046118 1.27469315] [ 0.51404696 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.51404696 1.01396046] [ 0.72348212 -0.28970299] [ 0.8281997 1.01396046] [ 1.81254495 1.01396046] [ 0.96642691 -0.0289703 ] [ 1.72877089 1.01396046] [ 1.30990057 1.27469315] [ 1.90050772 1.01396046] [-0.23991961 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.40932938 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.47215993 -0.0289703 ] [ 0.4302729 2.31762392]] Run example » Predict CO2 Values The task in the Multiple Regression chapter was to predict the CO2 emission from a car when you only knew its weight and volume.

To measure if the model is good enough, we can use a method called Train/Test. What is Train/Test Train/Test is a method to measure the accuracy of your model. It is called Train/Test because you split the data set into two sets: a training set and a testing set. 80% for training, and 20% for testing. You train the model using the training set. You test the model using the testing set. Train the model means create the model. Test the model means test the accuracy of the model. Start With a Data Set Start with a data set you want to test.

Example: the line indicates that a customer spending 6 minutes in the shop would make a purchase worth 200. That is probably a sign of overfitting. But what about the R-squared score? The R-squared score is a good indicator of how well my data set is fitting the model. R2 Remember R2, also known as R-squared?

A Decision Tree is a Flow Chart, and can help you make decisions based on previous experience. In the example, a person will try to decide if he/she should go to a comedy show or not. Luckily our example person has registered every time there was a comedy show in town, and registered some information about the comedian, and also registered if he/she went or not. Now, based on this data set, Python can create a decision tree that can be used to decide if any new shows are worth attending to. How Does it Work? First, read the dataset with pandas: Example Read and print the data set: Run example » To make a decision tree, all data has to be numerical. We have to convert the non numerical columns 'Nationality' and 'Go' into numerical values. Pandas has a map() method that takes a dictionary with information on how to convert the values. map() {'UK': 0, 'USA': 1, 'N': 2} {'UK': 0, 'USA': 1, 'N': 2} Means convert the values 'UK' to 0, 'USA' to 1, and 'N' to 2. Example Change string values into numerical values: Run example » Then we have to separate the feature columns from the target column. The feature columns are the columns that we try to predict from, and the target column is the column with the values we try to predict. Example X is the feature columns, y is the target column: X y Run example » Now we can create the actual decision tree, fit it with our details.

What is a confusion matrix? It is a table that is used in classification problems to assess where errors in the model were made. The rows represent the actual classes the outcomes should have been. While the columns represent the predictions we have made. Using this table it is easy to see which predictions are wrong. Creating a Confusion Matrix Confusion matrixes can be created by predictions made from a logistic regression. For now we will generate actual and predicted values by utilizing NumPy: import numpy import numpy Next we will need to generate the numbers for \"actual\" and \"predicted\" values. actual = numpy.random.binomial(1, 0.9, size = 1000) predicted = numpy.random.binomial(1, 0.9, size = 1000) actual = numpy.random.binomial(1, 0.9, size = 1000) predicted = numpy.random.binomial(1, 0.9, size = 1000) In order to create the confusion matrix we need to import metrics from the sklearn module. from sklearn import metrics from sklearn import metrics Once metrics is imported we can use the confusion matrix function on our actual and predicted values. confusion_matrix = metrics.confusion_matrix(actual, predicted) confusion_matrix = metrics.confusion_matrix(actual, predicted) To create a more interpretable visual display we need to convert the table into a confusion matrix display. cm_display = metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix = confusion_matrix, display_labels = [0, 1]) cm_display = metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix = confusion_matrix, display_labels = [0, 1]) Vizualizing the display requires that we import pyplot from matplotlib. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Finally to display the plot we can use the functions plot() and show() from pyplot. cm_display.plot() plt.show() cm_display.plot() plt.show() See the whole example in action: Example Result  Results Explained The Confusion Matrix created has four different quadrants: True Negative (Top-Left Quadrant) False Positive (Top-Right Quadrant) False Negative (Bottom-Left Quadrant) True Positive (Bottom-Right Quadrant) True means that the values were accurately predicted, False means that there was an error or wrong prediction. Now that we have made a Confusion Matrix, we can calculate different measures to quantify the quality of the model. First, lets look at Accuracy. ADVERTISEMENT Created Metrics The matrix provides us with many useful metrics that help us to evaluate our classification model. The different measures include: Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity (Recall), Specificity, and the F-score, explained below. Accuracy Accuracy measures how often the model is correct. How to Calculate (True Positive + True Negative) / Total Predictions Example Precision Of the positives predicted, what percentage is truly positive? How to Calculate True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive) Precision does not evaluate the correctly predicted negative cases: Example Sensitivity (Recall) Of all the positive cases, what percentage are predicted positive? Sensitivity (sometimes called Recall) measures how good the model is at predicting positives. This means it looks at true positives and false negatives (which are positives that have been incorrectly predicted as negative)."

Hierarchical Clustering Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning method for clustering data points. The algorithm builds clusters by measuring the dissimilarities between data. Unsupervised learning means that a model does not have to be trained, and we do not need a \"target\" variable. This method can be used on any data to visualize and interpret the relationship between individual data points. Here we will use hierarchical clustering to group data points and visualize the clusters using both a dendrogram and scatter plot. How does it work? We will use Agglomerative Clustering, a type of hierarchical clustering that follows a bottom up approach. We begin by treating each data point as its own cluster. Then, we join clusters together that have the shortest distance between them to create larger clusters. This step is repeated until one large cluster is formed containing all of the data points. Hierarchical clustering requires us to decide on both a distance and linkage method. We will use euclidean distance and the Ward linkage method, which attempts to minimize the variance between clusters. Example Start by visualizing some data points: Result  ADVERTISEMENT Now we compute the ward linkage using euclidean distance, and visualize it using a dendrogram: Example Result  Example Result  Example Explained Import the modules you need. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering You can learn about the Matplotlib module in our \"Matplotlib Tutorial.

    "document": "Machine Learning - Logistic Regression On this page, W3schools.com collaborates with NYC Data Science Academy, to deliver digital training content to our students. Logistic Regression Logistic regression aims to solve classification problems. It does this by predicting categorical outcomes, unlike linear regression that predicts a continuous outcome. In the simplest case there are two outcomes, which is called binomial, an example of which is predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign. Other cases have more than two outcomes to classify, in this case it is called multinomial. A common example for multinomial logistic regression would be predicting the class of an iris flower between 3 different species. Here we will be using basic logistic regression to predict a binomial variable. This means it has only two possible outcomes. How does it work? In Python we have modules that will do the work for us. Start by importing the NumPy module. import numpy import numpy Store the independent variables in X. Store the dependent variable in y. Below is a sample dataset: #X represents the size of a tumor in centimeters. X = numpy.array([3.78, 2.44, 2.09, 0.14, 1.72, 1.65, 4.92, 4.37, 4.96, 4.52, 3.69, 5.88]).reshape(-1,1) #Note: X has to be reshaped into a column from a row for the LogisticRegression() function to work. #y represents whether or not the tumor is cancerous (0 for \"No\", 1 for \"Yes\"). y = numpy.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) #X represents the size of a tumor in centimeters. X = numpy.array([3.78, 2.44, 2.09, 0.14, 1.72, 1.65, 4.92, 4.37, 4.96, 4.52, 3.69, 5.88]).reshape(-1,1) #Note: X has to be reshaped into a column from a row for the LogisticRegression() function to work. #y represents whether or not the tumor is cancerous (0 for \"No\", 1 for \"Yes\"). y = numpy.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) We will use a method from the sklearn module, so we will have to import that module as well: from sklearn import linear_model from sklearn import linear_model From the sklearn module we will use the LogisticRegression() method to create a logistic regression object. This object has a method called fit() that takes the independent and dependent values as parameters and fills the regression object with data that describes the relationship: fit() logr = linear_model.LogisticRegression() logr.fit(X,y) logr = linear_model.LogisticRegression() logr.fit(X,y) Now we have a logistic regression object that is ready to whether a tumor is cancerous based on the tumor size: #predict if tumor is cancerous where the size is 3.46mm: predicted = logr.predict(numpy.array([3.46]).reshape(-1,1)) #predict if tumor is cancerous where the size is 3.46mm: predicted = logr.predict(numpy.array([3.46]).reshape(-1,1)) Example See the whole example in action: Result [0] [0] We have predicted that a tumor with a size of 3.46mm will not be cancerous.

Example See the whole example in action: Result [4.03541657] [4.03541657] This tells us that as the size of a tumor increases by 1mm the odds of it being a cancerous tumor increases by 4x. Probability The coefficient and intercept values can be used to find the probability that each tumor is cancerous. Create a function that uses the model's coefficient and intercept values to return a new value. This new value represents probability that the given observation is a tumor: def logit2prob(logr,x): log_odds = logr.coef_ * x + logr.intercept_ odds = numpy.exp(log_odds) probability = odds / (1 + odds) return(probability) def logit2prob(logr,x): log_odds = logr.coef_ * x + logr.intercept_ odds = numpy.exp(log_odds) probability = odds / (1 + odds) return(probability) Function Explained To find the log-odds for each observation, we must first create a formula that looks similar to the one from linear regression, extracting the coefficient and the intercept. log_odds = logr.coef_ * x + logr.intercept_ log_odds = logr.coef_ * x + logr.intercept_ To then convert the log-odds to odds we must exponentiate the log-odds. odds = numpy.exp(log_odds) odds = numpy.exp(log_odds) Now that we have the odds, we can convert it to probability by dividing it by 1 plus the odds. probability = odds / (1 + odds) probability = odds / (1 + odds) Let us now use the function with what we have learned to find out the probability that each tumor is cancerous.

    "document": "Machine Learning - Grid Search On this page, W3schools.com collaborates with NYC Data Science Academy, to deliver digital training content to our students. Grid Search The majority of machine learning models contain parameters that can be adjusted to vary how the model learns. For example, the logistic regression model, from sklearn, has a parameter C that controls regularization,which affects the complexity of the model. sklearn C How do we pick the best value for C? The best value is dependent on the data used to train the model. C How does it work? One method is to try out different values and then pick the value that gives the best score. This technique is known as a grid search. If we had to select the values for two or more parameters, we would evaluate all combinations of the sets of values thus forming a grid of values. Before we get into the example it is good to know what the parameter we are changing does. Higher values of C tell the model, the training data resembles real world information, place a greater weight on the training data. While lower values of C do the opposite. C C Using Default Parameters First let's see what kind of results we can generate without a grid search using only the base parameters. To get started we must first load in the dataset we will be working with. from sklearn import datasets iris = datasets.load_iris() from sklearn import datasets iris = datasets.load_iris() Next in order to create the model we must have a set of independent variables X and a dependant variable y. X = iris['data'] y = iris['target'] X = iris['data'] y = iris['target'] Now we will load the logistic model for classifying the iris flowers. from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression Creating the model, setting max_iter to a higher value to ensure that the model finds a result. Keep in mind the default value for C in a logistic regression model is 1, we will compare this later. C 1 In the example below, we look at the iris data set and try to train a model with varying values for C in logistic regression. C logit = LogisticRegression(max_iter = 10000) logit = LogisticRegression(max_iter = 10000) After we create the model, we must fit the model to the data. print(logit.fit(X,y)) print(logit.fit(X,y)) To evaluate the model we run the score method. print(logit.score(X,y)) print(logit.score(X,y)) Example With the default setting of C = 1, we achieved a score of 0.973. C = 1 0.973 Let's see if we can do any better by implementing a grid search with difference values of 0.973. ADVERTISEMENT Implementing Grid Search We will follow the same steps of before except this time we will set a range of values for C. C Knowing which values to set for the searched parameters will take a combination of domain knowledge and practice. Since the default value for C is 1, we will set a range of values surrounding it."

C First we will create an empty list to store the score within. scores = [] scores = [] To change the values of C we must loop over the range of values and update the parameter each time. C for choice in C: logit.set_params(C=choice) logit.fit(X, y) scores.append(logit.score(X, y)) for choice in C: logit.set_params(C=choice) logit.fit(X, y) scores.append(logit.score(X, y)) With the scores stored in a list, we can evaluate what the best choice of C is. C print(scores) print(scores) Example Results Explained We can see that the lower values of C performed worse than the base parameter of 1. However, as we increased the value of C to 1.75 the model experienced increased accuracy. C 1 C 1.75 It seems that increasing C beyond this amount does not help increase model accuracy. C Note on Best Practices We scored our logistic regression model by using the same data that was used to train it. If the model corresponds too closely to that data, it may not be great at predicting unseen data. This statistical error is known as over fitting. To avoid being misled by the scores on the training data, we can put aside a portion of our data and use it specifically for the purpose of testing the model. Refer to the lecture on train/test splitting to avoid being misled and overfitting."

The information about the car brand or the car model might help us make a better prediction of the CO2 emitted. ADVERTISEMENT One Hot Encoding We cannot make use of the Car or Model column in our data since they are not numeric. A linear relationship between a categorical variable, Car or Model, and a numeric variable, CO2, cannot be determined. To fix this issue, we must have a numeric representation of the categorical variable. One way to do this is to have a column representing each group in the category. For each column, the values will be 1 or 0 where 1 represents the inclusion of the group and 0 represents the exclusion. This transformation is called one hot encoding. You do not have to do this manually, the Python Pandas module has a function that called get_dummies() which does one hot encoding. get_dummies() Learn about the Pandas module in our Pandas Tutorial."

The information can be retained using 1 column less than the number of groups you have. For example, you have a column representing colors and in that column, you have two colors, red and blue. Example Result color 0 blue 1 red color 0 blue 1 red You can create 1 column called red where 1 represents red and 0 represents not red, which means it is blue. To do this, we can use the same function that we used for one hot encoding, get_dummies, and then drop one of the columns. There is an argument, drop_first, which allows us to exclude the first column from the resulting table. Example Result color_red 0 0 1 1 color_red 0 0 1 1 What if you have more than 2 groups? How can the multiple groups be represented by 1 less column? Let's say we have three colors this time, red, blue and green.

K-means K-means is an unsupervised learning method for clustering data points. The algorithm iteratively divides data points into K clusters by minimizing the variance in each cluster. Here, we will show you how to estimate the best value for K using the elbow method, then use K-means clustering to group the data points into clusters. How does it work? First, each data point is randomly assigned to one of the K clusters. Then, we compute the centroid (functionally the center) of each cluster, and reassign each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid. We repeat this process until the cluster assignments for each data point are no longer changing. K-means clustering requires us to select K, the number of clusters we want to group the data into. The elbow method lets us graph the inertia (a distance-based metric) and visualize the point at which it starts decreasing linearly. This point is referred to as the \"elbow\" and is a good estimate for the best value for K based on our data. Example Start by visualizing some data points: Result  ADVERTISEMENT Now we utilize the elbow method to visualize the intertia for different values of K: Example Result  The elbow method shows that 2 is a good value for K, so we retrain and visualize the result: Example Result  Example Explained Import the modules you need. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.cluster import KMeans import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.cluster import KMeans You can learn about the Matplotlib module in our \"Matplotlib Tutorial. scikit-learn is a popular library for machine learning.

Bagging Methods such as Decision Trees, can be prone to overfitting on the training set which can lead to wrong predictions on new data. Bootstrap Aggregation (bagging) is a ensembling method that attempts to resolve overfitting for classification or regression problems. Bagging aims to improve the accuracy and performance of machine learning algorithms. It does this by taking random subsets of an original dataset, with replacement, and fits either a classifier (for classification) or regressor (for regression) to each subset. The predictions for each subset are then aggregated through majority vote for classification or averaging for regression, increasing prediction accuracy. Evaluating a Base Classifier To see how bagging can improve model performance, we must start by evaluating how the base classifier performs on the dataset. If you do not know what decision trees are review the lesson on decision trees before moving forward, as bagging is a continuation of the concept. We will be looking to identify different classes of wines found in Sklearn's wine dataset. from sklearn import datasets from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn import datasets from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier Next we need to load in the data and store it into X (input features) and y (target). The parameter as_frame is set equal to True so we do not lose the feature names when loading the data. (sklearn version older than 0.23 must skip the as_frame argument as it is not supported) sklearn as_frame data = datasets.load_wine(as_frame = True) X = data.data y = data.target data = datasets.load_wine(as_frame = True) X = data.data y = data.target In order to properly evaluate our model on unseen data, we need to split X and y into train and test sets. For information on splitting data, see the Train/Test lesson. X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 22) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 22) With our data prepared, we can now instantiate a base classifier and fit it to the training data. dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 22) dtree.fit(X_train,y_train) dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 22) dtree.fit(X_train,y_train) Result: DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=22) DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=22) We can now predict the class of wine the unseen test set and evaluate the model performance. y_pred = dtree.predict(X_test) print(\"Train data accuracy:\",accuracy_score(y_true = y_train, y_pred = dtree.predict(X_train))) print(\"Test data accuracy:\",accuracy_score(y_true = y_test, y_pred = y_pred)) y_pred = dtree.predict(X_test) print(\"Train data accuracy:\",accuracy_score(y_true = y_train, y_pred = dtree.predict(X_train))) print(\"Test data accuracy:\",accuracy_score(y_true = y_test, y_pred = y_pred)) Result: Train data accuracy: 1.0 Test data accuracy: 0.8222222222222222 Train data accuracy: 1.0 Test data accuracy: 0.8222222222222222 Example Import the necessary data and evaluate base classifier performance."

ADVERTISEMENT Creating a Bagging Classifier For bagging we need to set the parameter n_estimators, this is the number of base classifiers that our model is going to aggregate together. For this sample dataset the number of estimators is relatively low, it is often the case that much larger ranges are explored. Hyperparameter tuning is usually done with a grid search, but for now we will use a select set of values for the number of estimators. We start by importing the necessary model. from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier Now lets create a range of values that represent the number of estimators we want to use in each ensemble. estimator_range = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16] estimator_range = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16] To see how the Bagging Classifier performs with differing values of n_estimators we need a way to iterate over the range of values and store the results from each ensemble. To do this we will create a for loop, storing the models and scores in separate lists for later visualizations. Note: The default parameter for the base classifier in BaggingClassifier is the DecisionTreeClassifier therefore we do not need to set it when instantiating the bagging model. BaggingClassifier DecisionTreeClassifier models = [] scores = [] for n_estimators in estimator_range: # Create bagging classifier clf = BaggingClassifier(n_estimators = n_estimators, random_state = 22) # Fit the model clf.fit(X_train, y_train) # Append the model and score to their respective list models.append(clf) scores.append(accuracy_score(y_true = y_test, y_pred = clf.predict(X_test))) models = [] scores = [] for n_estimators in estimator_range: # Create bagging classifier clf = BaggingClassifier(n_estimators = n_estimators, random_state = 22) # Fit the model clf.fit(X_train, y_train) # Append the model and score to their respective list models.append(clf) scores.append(accuracy_score(y_true = y_test, y_pred = clf.predict(X_test))) With the models and scores stored, we can now visualize the improvement in model performance. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Generate the plot of scores against number of estimators plt.figure(figsize=(9,6)) plt.plot(estimator_range, scores) # Adjust labels and font (to make visable) plt.xlabel(\"n_estimators\", fontsize = 18) plt.ylabel(\"score\", fontsize = 18) plt.tick_params(labelsize = 16) # Visualize plot plt.show() import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Generate the plot of scores against number of estimators plt.figure(figsize=(9,6)) plt.plot(estimator_range, scores) # Adjust labels and font (to make visable) plt.xlabel(\"n_estimators\", fontsize = 18) plt.ylabel(\"score\", fontsize = 18) plt.tick_params(labelsize = 16) # Visualize plot plt.show()  Example Import the necessary data and evaluate the BaggingClassifier performance. BaggingClassifier Result  Results Explained By iterating through different values for the number of estimators we can see an increase in model performance from 82.2% to 95.5%. After 14 estimators the accuracy begins to drop, again if you set a different random_state the values you see will vary."

  {
    "document": "That is why it is best practice to use cross validation to ensure stable results. random_state In this case, we see a 13.3% increase in accuracy when it comes to identifying the type of the wine. Another Form of Evaluation As bootstrapping chooses random subsets of observations to create classifiers, there are observations that are left out in the selection process. These \"out-of-bag\" observations can then be used to evaluate the model, similarly to that of a test set. Keep in mind, that out-of-bag estimation can overestimate error in binary classification problems and should only be used as a compliment to other metrics. We saw in the last exercise that 12 estimators yielded the highest accuracy, so we will use that to create our model. This time setting the parameter oob_score to true to evaluate the model with out-of-bag score. oob_score Example Create a model with out-of-bag metric. Since the samples used in OOB and the test set are different, and the dataset is relatively small, there is a difference in the accuracy. It is rare that they would be exactly the same, again OOB should be used quick means for estimating error, but is not the only evaluation metric. Generating Decision Trees from Bagging Classifier As was seen in the Decision Tree lesson, it is possible to graph the decision tree the model created. It is also possible to see the individual decision trees that went into the aggregated classifier. This helps us to gain a more intuitive understanding on how the bagging model arrives at its predictions. Note: This is only functional with smaller datasets, where the trees are relatively shallow and narrow making them easy to visualize. We will need to import plot_tree function from sklearn.tree. The different trees can be graphed by changing the estimator you wish to visualize. plot_tree sklearn.tree Example Generate Decision Trees from Bagging Classifier Result  Here we can see just the first decision tree that was used to vote on the final prediction. Again, by changing the index of the classifier you can see each of the trees that have been aggregated."

    "document": "Machine Learning - Cross Validation On this page, W3schools.com collaborates with NYC Data Science Academy, to deliver digital training content to our students. Cross Validation When adjusting models we are aiming to increase overall model performance on unseen data. Hyperparameter tuning can lead to much better performance on test sets. However, optimizing parameters to the test set can lead information leakage causing the model to preform worse on unseen data. To correct for this we can perform cross validation. To better understand CV, we will be performing different methods on the iris dataset. Let us first load in and separate the data. from sklearn import datasets X, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True) from sklearn import datasets X, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True) There are many methods to cross validation, we will start by looking at k-fold cross validation. K-Fold The training data used in the model is split, into k number of smaller sets, to be used to validate the model. The model is then trained on k-1 folds of training set. The remaining fold is then used as a validation set to evaluate the model. As we will be trying to classify different species of iris flowers we will need to import a classifier model, for this exercise we will be using a DecisionTreeClassifier. We will also need to import CV modules from sklearn. DecisionTreeClassifier sklearn from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score With the data loaded we can now create and fit a model for evaluation. clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42) clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42) Now let's evaluate our model and see how it performs on each k-fold. k_folds = KFold(n_splits = 5) scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv = k_folds) k_folds = KFold(n_splits = 5) scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv = k_folds) It is also good pratice to see how CV performed overall by averaging the scores for all folds. Example Run k-fold CV: ADVERTISEMENT Stratified K-Fold In cases where classes are imbalanced we need a way to account for the imbalance in both the train and validation sets. To do so we can stratify the target classes, meaning that both sets will have an equal proportion of all classes. Example While the number of folds is the same, the average CV increases from the basic k-fold when making sure there is stratified classes. Leave-One-Out (LOO) Instead of selecting the number of splits in the training data set like k-fold LeaveOneOut, utilize 1 observation to validate and n-1 observations to train. This method is an exaustive technique. Example Run LOO CV: We can observe that the number of cross validation scores performed is equal to the number of observations in the dataset. In this case there are 150 observations in the iris dataset. The average CV score is 94%. Leave-P-Out (LPO) Leave-P-Out is simply a nuanced diffence to the Leave-One-Out idea, in that we can select the number of p to use in our validation set."

  {
    "document": "Example Run LPO CV: As we can see this is an exhaustive method we many more scores being calculated than Leave-One-Out, even with a p = 2, yet it achieves roughly the same average CV score. Shuffle Split Unlike KFold, ShuffleSplit leaves out a percentage of the data, not to be used in the train or validation sets. To do so we must decide what the train and test sizes are, as well as the number of splits. KFold ShuffleSplit Example Run Shuffle Split CV: Ending Notes These are just a few of the CV methods that can be applied to models. There are many more cross validation classes, with most models having their own class. Check out sklearns cross validation for more CV options."

Another common metric is AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Reciever operating characteristic curve plots the true positive (TP) rate versus the false positive (FP) rate at different classification thresholds. The thresholds are different probability cutoffs that separate the two classes in binary classification. It uses probability to tell us how well a model separates the classes. Imbalanced Data Suppose we have an imbalanced data set where the majority of our data is of one value. We can obtain high accuracy for the model by predicting the majority class. Example ADVERTISEMENT Although we obtain a very high accuracy, the model provided no information about the data so it's not useful. We accurately predict class 1 100% of the time while inaccurately predict class 0 0% of the time. At the expense of accuracy, it might be better to have a model that can somewhat separate the two classes. Example For the second set of predictions, we do not have as high of an accuracy score as the first but the accuracy for each class is more balanced. Using accuracy as an evaluation metric we would rate the first model higher than the second even though it doesn't tell us anything about the data. In cases like this, using another evaluation metric like AUC would be preferred. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def plot_roc_curve(true_y, y_prob): \"\"\" plots the roc curve based of the probabilities \"\"\" fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(true_y, y_prob) plt.plot(fpr, tpr) plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def plot_roc_curve(true_y, y_prob): \"\"\" plots the roc curve based of the probabilities \"\"\" fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(true_y, y_prob) plt.plot(fpr, tpr) plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') Example Model 1: Result model 1 AUC score: 0.5 Example Model 2: Result model 2 AUC score: 0.8270551578947367 An AUC score of around .5 would mean that the model is unable to make a distinction between the two classes and the curve would look like a line with a slope of 1. An AUC score closer to 1 means that the model has the ability to separate the two classes and the curve would come closer to the top left corner of the graph. Probabilities Because AUC is a metric that utilizes probabilities of the class predictions, we can be more confident in a model that has a higher AUC score than one with a lower score even if they have similar accuracies. In the data below, we have two sets of probabilites from hypothetical models."

    "document": "The first has probabilities that are not as \"confident\" when predicting the two classes (the probabilities are close to .5). The second has probabilities that are more \"confident\" when predicting the two classes (the probabilities are close to the extremes of 0 or 1). Example Example Plot model 1: Result  Example Plot model 2: Result  Even though the accuracies for the two models are similar, the model with the higher AUC score will be more reliable because it takes into account the predicted probability. It is more likely to give you higher accuracy when predicting future data."

    "document": "Machine Learning - K-nearest neighbors (KNN) On this page, W3schools.com collaborates with NYC Data Science Academy, to deliver digital training content to our students. KNN KNN is a simple, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks - and is also frequently used in missing value imputation. It is based on the idea that the observations closest to a given data point are the most \"similar\" observations in a data set, and we can therefore classify unforeseen points based on the values of the closest existing points. By choosing K, the user can select the number of nearby observations to use in the algorithm. Here, we will show you how to implement the KNN algorithm for classification, and show how different values of K affect the results. How does it work? K is the number of nearest neighbors to use. For classification, a majority vote is used to determined which class a new observation should fall into. Larger values of K are often more robust to outliers and produce more stable decision boundaries than very small values (K=3 would be better than K=1, which might produce undesirable results. Example Start by visualizing some data points: Result  ADVERTISEMENT Now we fit the KNN algorithm with K=1: from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier data = list(zip(x, y)) knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1) knn.fit(data, classes) from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier data = list(zip(x, y)) knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1) knn.fit(data, classes) And use it to classify a new data point: Example Result  Now we do the same thing, but with a higher K value which changes the prediction: Example Result  Example Explained Import the modules you need.

First we create new x and y features, and then call knn.predict() on the new data point to get a class of 0 or 1: knn.predict() new_x = 8 new_y = 21 new_point = [(new_x, new_y)] prediction = knn.predict(new_point) print(prediction) new_x = 8 new_y = 21 new_point = [(new_x, new_y)] prediction = knn.predict(new_point) print(prediction) Result: [0] [0] When we plot all the data along with the new point and class, we can see it's been labeled blue with the 1 class.

React is also known as React.js or ReactJS. React is a tool for building UI components. How does React Work? React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed! React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method. function class constructor() Example A simple class constructor: class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } } class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } } Notice the case of the class name. We have begun the name, \"Car\", with an uppercase character. This is a standard naming convention for classes. Now you can create objects using the Car class: Example Create an object called \"mycar\" based on the Car class: class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } } const mycar = new Car(\"Ford\"); class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } } const mycar = new Car(\"Ford\"); Try it Yourself » Note: The constructor function is called automatically when the object is initialized. Method in Classes You can add your own methods in a class: Example Create a method named \"present\": class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } present() { return 'I have a ' + this.brand; } } const mycar = new Car(\"Ford\"); mycar.present(); class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } present() { return 'I have a ' + this.brand; } } const mycar = new Car(\"Ford\"); mycar.present(); Try it Yourself » As you can see in the example above, you call the method by referring to the object's method name followed by parentheses (parameters would go inside the parentheses). Class Inheritance To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword. extends A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class: Example Create a class named \"Model\" which will inherit the methods from the \"Car\" class: class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } present() { return 'I have a ' + this.brand; } } class Model extends Car { constructor(name, mod) { super(name); this.model = mod; } show() { return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model } } const mycar = new Model(\"Ford\", \"Mustang\"); mycar.show(); class Car { constructor(name) { this.brand = name; } present() { return 'I have a ' + this.brand; } } class Model extends Car { constructor(name, mod) { super(name); this.model = mod; } show() { return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model } } const mycar = new Model(\"Ford\", \"Mustang\"); mycar.show(); Try it Yourself » The super() method refers to the parent class. super() By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and get access to the parent's properties and methods. super() To learn more about classes, check out our JavaScript Classes section."

The render Method The render() method is then called to define the React component that should be rendered. render() But render where? There is another folder in the root directory of your React project, named \"public\". In this folder, there is an index.html file. index.html You'll notice a single <div> in the body of this file. This is where our React application will be rendered. <div> Example Display a paragraph inside an element with the id of \"root\": const container = document.getElementById('root'); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container); root.render(<p>Hello</p>); const container = document.getElementById('root'); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container); root.render(<p>Hello</p>); The result is displayed in the <div id=\"root\"> element: <div id=\"root\"> <body> <div id=\"root\"></div> </body> <body> <div id=\"root\"></div> </body> Run Example » Note that the element id does not have to be called \"root\", but this is the standard convention. The HTML Code The HTML code in this tutorial uses JSX which allows you to write HTML tags inside the JavaScript code: Do not worry if the syntax is unfamiliar, you will learn more about JSX in the next chapter. Example Create a variable that contains HTML code and display it in the \"root\" node: const myelement = ( <table> <tr> <th>Name</th> </tr> <tr> <td>John</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Elsa</td> </tr> </table> ); const container = document.getElementById('root'); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container); root.render(myelement); const myelement = ( <table> <tr> <th>Name</th> </tr> <tr> <td>John</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Elsa</td> </tr> </table> ); const container = document.getElementById('root'); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container); root.render(myelement); Run Example » The Root Node The root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result.

Coding JSX JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. createElement() appendChild() JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications. Here are two examples. The first uses JSX and the second does not: Example 1 JSX: const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(myElement); const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(myElement); Run Example » Example 2 Without JSX: const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX! '); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(myElement); const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX! '); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(myElement); Run Example » As you can see in the first example, JSX allows us to write HTML directly within the JavaScript code. JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime. Expressions in JSX With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }. { } The expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression. JSX will execute the expression and return the result: Example Execute the expression 5 + 5: 5 + 5 const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>; const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>; Run Example » Inserting a Large Block of HTML To write HTML on multiple lines, put the HTML inside parentheses: Example Create a list with three list items: const myElement = ( <ul> <li>Apples</li> <li>Bananas</li> <li>Cherries</li> </ul> ); const myElement = ( <ul> <li>Apples</li> <li>Bananas</li> <li>Cherries</li> </ul> ); Run Example » One Top Level Element The HTML code must be wrapped in ONE top level element. So if you like to write two paragraphs, you must put them inside a parent element, like a div element. div Example Wrap two paragraphs inside one DIV element: const myElement = ( <div> <p>I am a paragraph.</p> <p>I am a paragraph too.</p> </div> ); const myElement = ( <div> <p>I am a paragraph.</p> <p>I am a paragraph too.</p> </div> ); Run Example » JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not correct, or if the HTML misses a parent element. Alternatively, you can use a \"fragment\" to wrap multiple lines. This will prevent unnecessarily adding extra nodes to the DOM. A fragment looks like an empty HTML tag: <></>."

Example Close empty elements with /> /> const myElement = <input type=\"text\" />; const myElement = <input type=\"text\" />; Run Example » JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not properly closed. Attribute class = className The class attribute is a much used attribute in HTML, but since JSX is rendered as JavaScript, and the class keyword is a reserved word in JavaScript, you are not allowed to use it in JSX. class class Use attribute className instead. className JSX solved this by using className instead. When JSX is rendered, it translates className attributes into class attributes. className className class Example Use attribute className instead of class in JSX: className class const myElement = <h1 className=\"myclass\">Hello World</h1>; const myElement = <h1 className=\"myclass\">Hello World</h1>; Run Example » Conditions - if statements React supports if statements, but not inside JSX. if To be able to use conditional statements in JSX, you should put the if statements outside of the JSX, or you could use a ternary expression instead: if Write if statements outside of the JSX code: if Example Write \"Hello\" if x is less than 10, otherwise \"Goodbye\": x const x = 5; let text = \"Goodbye\"; if (x < 10) { text = \"Hello\"; } const myElement = <h1>{text}</h1>; const x = 5; let text = \"Goodbye\"; if (x < 10) { text = \"Hello\"; } const myElement = <h1>{text}</h1>; Run Example » Use ternary expressions instead: Example Write \"Hello\" if x is less than 10, otherwise \"Goodbye\": x const x = 5; const myElement = <h1>{(x) < 10 ? \"Hello\" : \"Goodbye\"}</h1>; const x = 5; const myElement = <h1>{(x) < 10 ? \"Hello\" : \"Goodbye\"}</h1>; Run Example » Note that in order to embed a JavaScript expression inside JSX, the JavaScript must be wrapped with curly braces, {}. {}"

There is an optional section on Class components for your reference. Create Your First Component When creating a React component, the component's name MUST start with an upper case letter. Class Component A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions. extends React.Component The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML. render() Example Create a Class component called Car Car class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>; } } class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>; } } Function Component Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

To do that, create a new file with a .js file extension and put the code inside it: .js Note that the filename must start with an uppercase character.

Example Now we import the \"Car.js\" file in the application, and we can use the Car component as if it was created here. Car import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; import Car from './Car.js'; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car />); import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; import Car from './Car.js'; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car />); Run Example »"

The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions. extends React.Component The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML. render() Example Create a Class component called Car Car class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>; } } class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>; } } Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns a <h2> element. <h2> To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: <Car /> <Car /> Example Display the Car component in the \"root\" element: Car const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car />); const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car />); Run Example » Component Constructor If there is a constructor() function in your component, this function will be called when the component gets initiated. constructor() constructor() The constructor function is where you initiate the component's properties. In React, component properties should be kept in an object called state. state You will learn more about state later in this tutorial. state The constructor function is also where you honor the inheritance of the parent component by including the super() statement, which executes the parent component's constructor function, and your component has access to all the functions of the parent component (React.Component)."

    "document": "super() React.Component Example Create a constructor function in the Car component, and add a color property: class Car extends React.Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = {color: \"red\"}; } render() { return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>; } } class Car extends React.Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = {color: \"red\"}; } render() { return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>; } } Use the color property in the render() function: Example class Car extends React.Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = {color: \"red\"}; } render() { return <h2>I am a {this.state.color} Car!</h2>; } } class Car extends React.Component { constructor() { super(); this.state = {color: \"red\"}; } render() { return <h2>I am a {this.state.color} Car!</h2>; } } Run Example » Props Another way of handling component properties is by using props. props Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes. You will learn more about props in the next chapter. props Example Use an attribute to pass a color to the Car component, and use it in the render() function: class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>I am a {this.props.color} Car!</h2>; } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car color=\"red\"/>); class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>I am a {this.props.color} Car!</h2>; } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car color=\"red\"/>); Run Example » Props in the Constructor If your component has a constructor function, the props should always be passed to the constructor and also to the React.Component via the super() method. super() Example class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <h2>I am a {this.props.model}!</h2>; } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car model=\"Mustang\"/>); class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <h2>I am a {this.props.model}!</h2>; } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car model=\"Mustang\"/>); Run Example » Components in Components We can refer to components inside other components: Example Use the Car component inside the Garage component: class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>; } } class Garage extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div> <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1> <Car /> </div> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Garage />); class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>; } } class Garage extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div> <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1> <Car /> </div> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Garage />); Run Example » Components in Files React is all about re-using code, and it can be smart to insert some of your components in separate files. To do that, create a new file with a .js file extension and put the code inside it: .js Note that the file must start by importing React (as before), and it has to end with the statement export default Car;."
  },
  {
    "document": "export default Car; Example This is the new file, we named it Car.js: Car.js import React from 'react'; class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>; } } export default Car; import React from 'react'; class Car extends React.Component { render() { return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>; } } export default Car; To be able to use the Car component, you have to import the file in your application. Car Example Now we import the Car.js file in the application, and we can use the Car component as if it was created here. Car.js Car import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; import Car from './Car.js'; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car />); import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; import Car from './Car.js'; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Car />); Run Example » React Class Component State React Class components have a built-in state object. state You might have noticed that we used state earlier in the component constructor section. state The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. state When the state object changes, the component re-renders. state Creating the state Object The state object is initialized in the constructor: Example Specify the state object in the constructor method: state class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {brand: \"Ford\"}; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My Car</h1> </div> ); } } class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {brand: \"Ford\"}; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My Car</h1> </div> ); } } The state object can contain as many properties as you like: Example Specify all the properties your component need: class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { brand: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", color: \"red\", year: 1964 }; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My Car</h1> </div> ); } } class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { brand: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", color: \"red\", year: 1964 }; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My Car</h1> </div> ); } } Using the state Object state Refer to the state object anywhere in the component by using the this.state.propertyname syntax: state this.state.propertyname Example: Refer to the state object in the render() method: state render() class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { brand: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", color: \"red\", year: 1964 }; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My {this.state.brand}</h1> <p> It is a {this.state.color} {this.state.model} from {this.state.year}. </p> </div> ); } } class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { brand: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", color: \"red\", year: 1964 }; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My {this.state.brand}</h1> <p> It is a {this.state.color} {this.state.model} from {this.state.year}. </p> </div> ); } } Run Example » Changing the state Object state To change a value in the state object, use the this.setState() method."
  },
  {
    "document": "this.setState() When a value in the state object changes, the component will re-render, meaning that the output will change according to the new value(s). state Example: Add a button with an onClick event that will change the color property: onClick class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { brand: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", color: \"red\", year: 1964 }; } changeColor = () => { this.setState({color: \"blue\"}); } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My {this.state.brand}</h1> <p> It is a {this.state.color} {this.state.model} from {this.state.year}. </p> <button type=\"button\" onClick={this.changeColor} >Change color</button> </div> ); } } class Car extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { brand: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", color: \"red\", year: 1964 }; } changeColor = () => { this.setState({color: \"blue\"}); } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My {this.state.brand}</h1> <p> It is a {this.state.color} {this.state.model} from {this.state.year}. </p> <button type=\"button\" onClick={this.changeColor} >Change color</button> </div> ); } } Run Example » Always use the setState() method to change the state object, it will ensure that the component knows its been updated and calls the render() method (and all the other lifecycle methods). setState() Lifecycle of Components Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Mounting Mounting means putting elements into the DOM. React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component: constructor() getDerivedStateFromProps() render() componentDidMount() The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them. render() constructor The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values. constructor() state The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component). constructor() props super(props) React.Component Example: The constructor method is called, by React, every time you make a component: constructor class Header extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {favoritecolor: \"red\"}; } render() { return ( <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Header />); class Header extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {favoritecolor: \"red\"}; } render() { return ( <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Header />); Run Example » getDerivedStateFromProps The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. getDerivedStateFromProps() This is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props."

    "document": "It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.The example below starts with the favorite color being \"red\", but the getDerivedStateFromProps() method updates the favorite color based on the favcol attribute: Example: The getDerivedStateFromProps method is called right before the render method: class Header extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {favoritecolor: \"red\"}; } static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) { return {favoritecolor: props.favcol }; } render() { return ( <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Header favcol=\"yellow\"/>); Run Example » render The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM. Example: A simple component with a simple render() method: class Header extends React.Component { render() { return ( <h1>This is the content of the Header component</h1> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Header />); Run Example » componentDidMount The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered. This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM. Example: At first my favorite color is red, but give me a second, and it is yellow instead: class Header extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {favoritecolor: \"red\"}; } componentDidMount() { setTimeout(() => { this.setState({favoritecolor: \"yellow\"}) }, 1000) } render() { return ( <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Header />); Run Example » Updating The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated. A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props. React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated: getDerivedStateFromProps() shouldComponentUpdate() render() getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() componentDidUpdate() The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them. getDerivedStateFromProps Also at updates the getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated. This is still the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props. The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue, but since the getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called, which updates the state with the color from the favcol attribute, the favorite color is still rendered as yellow: Example: If the component gets updated, the getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called: class Header extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {favoritecolor: \"red\"}; } static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) { return {favoritecolor: props.favcol }; } changeColor = () => { this.setState({favoritecolor: \"blue\"}); } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1> <button type=\"button\" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button> </div> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Header favcol=\"yellow\" />); Run Example » shouldComponentUpdate In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not. The default value is true."

If the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is present, you should also include the componentDidUpdate() method, otherwise you will get an error. The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this: When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color \"red\". When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and after one second, the favorite color becomes \"yellow\". This action triggers the update phase, and since this component has a getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method, this method is executed, and writes a message to the empty DIV1 element. Then the componentDidUpdate() method is executed and writes a message in the empty DIV2 element: Example: Use the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method to find out what the state object looked like before the update: class Header extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {favoritecolor: \"red\"}; } componentDidMount() { setTimeout(() => { this.setState({favoritecolor: \"yellow\"}) }, 1000) } getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { document.getElementById(\"div1\").innerHTML = \"Before the update, the favorite was \" + prevState.favoritecolor; } componentDidUpdate() { document.getElementById(\"div2\").innerHTML = \"The updated favorite is \" + this.state.favoritecolor; } render() { return ( <div> <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1> <div id=\"div1\"></div> <div id=\"div2\"></div> </div> ); } } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Header />); Run Example » componentDidUpdate The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM."

In React, form data is usually handled by the components. When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.

Add React Router To add React Router in your application, run this in the terminal from the root directory of the application: Note: This tutorial uses React Router v6. If you are upgrading from v5, you will need to use the @latest flag: Folder Structure To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure. Within the src folder, we'll create a folder named pages with several files: src pages src\\pages\\: src\\pages\\ Layout.js Home.js Blogs.js Contact.js NoPage.js Each file will contain a very basic React component. Basic Usage Now we will use our Router in our index.js file. index.js Example Use React Router to route to pages based on URL: index.js: index.js import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from \"react-router-dom\"; import Layout from \"./pages/Layout\"; import Home from \"./pages/Home\"; import Blogs from \"./pages/Blogs\"; import Contact from \"./pages/Contact\"; import NoPage from \"./pages/NoPage\"; export default function App() { return ( <BrowserRouter> <Routes> <Route path=\"/\" element={<Layout />}> <Route index element={<Home />} /> <Route path=\"blogs\" element={<Blogs />} /> <Route path=\"contact\" element={<Contact />} /> <Route path=\"*\" element={<NoPage />} /> </Route> </Routes> </BrowserRouter> ); } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<App />); import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from \"react-router-dom\"; import Layout from \"./pages/Layout\"; import Home from \"./pages/Home\"; import Blogs from \"./pages/Blogs\"; import Contact from \"./pages/Contact\"; import NoPage from \"./pages/NoPage\"; export default function App() { return ( <BrowserRouter> <Routes> <Route path=\"/\" element={<Layout />}> <Route index element={<Home />} /> <Route path=\"blogs\" element={<Blogs />} /> <Route path=\"contact\" element={<Contact />} /> <Route path=\"*\" element={<NoPage />} /> </Route> </Routes> </BrowserRouter> ); } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<App />); Run Example » Example Explained We wrap our content first with <BrowserRouter>. <BrowserRouter> Then we define our <Routes>. An application can have multiple <Routes>. Our basic example only uses one. <Routes> <Routes> <Route>s can be nested. The first <Route> has a path of / and renders the Layout component. <Route> <Route> / Layout The nested <Route>s inherit and add to the parent route. So the blogs path is combined with the parent and becomes /blogs. <Route> blogs /blogs The Home component route does not have a path but has an index attribute. That specifies this route as the default route for the parent route, which is /. Home index / Setting the path to * will act as a catch-all for any undefined URLs. This is great for a 404 error page. path * Pages / Components The Layout component has <Outlet> and <Link> elements. Layout <Outlet> <Link> The <Outlet> renders the current route selected. <Outlet> <Link> is used to set the URL and keep track of browsing history. <Link> Anytime we link to an internal path, we will use <Link> instead of <a href=\"\">. <Link> <a href=\"\"> The \"layout route\" is a shared component that inserts common content on all pages, such as a navigation menu."

Initialize useState useState We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component. useState useState accepts an initial state and returns two values: useState Example: Initialize state at the top of the function component. import { useState } from \"react\"; function FavoriteColor() { const [color, setColor] = useState(\"\"); } import { useState } from \"react\"; function FavoriteColor() { const [color, setColor] = useState(\"\"); } Notice that again, we are destructuring the returned values from useState. useState The first value, color, is our current state. color The second value, setColor, is the function that is used to update our state. setColor These names are variables that can be named anything you would like. Lastly, we set the initial state to an empty string: useState(\"\") useState(\"\") Read State We can now include our state anywhere in our component.

The second argument is optional. useEffect useEffect(<function>, <dependency>) useEffect(<function>, <dependency>) Let's use a timer as an example. Example: Use setTimeout() to count 1 second after initial render: setTimeout() import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function Timer() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); useEffect(() => { setTimeout(() => { setCount((count) => count + 1); }, 1000); }); return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>; } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Timer />); import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function Timer() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); useEffect(() => { setTimeout(() => { setCount((count) => count + 1); }, 1000); }); return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>; } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Timer />); Run Example » But wait!! It keeps counting even though it should only count once! useEffect runs on every render. That means that when the count changes, a render happens, which then triggers another effect. useEffect This is not what we want. There are several ways to control when side effects run. We should always include the second parameter which accepts an array. We can optionally pass dependencies to useEffect in this array. useEffect Example 1. No dependency passed: useEffect(() => { //Runs on every render }); useEffect(() => { //Runs on every render }); Example 2. An empty array: useEffect(() => { //Runs only on the first render }, []); useEffect(() => { //Runs only on the first render }, []); Example 3. Props or state values: useEffect(() => { //Runs on the first render //And any time any dependency value changes }, [prop, state]); useEffect(() => { //Runs on the first render //And any time any dependency value changes }, [prop, state]); So, to fix this issue, let's only run this effect on the initial render. Example: Only run the effect on the initial render: import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function Timer() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); useEffect(() => { setTimeout(() => { setCount((count) => count + 1); }, 1000); }, []); // <- add empty brackets here return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>; } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Timer />); import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function Timer() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); useEffect(() => { setTimeout(() => { setCount((count) => count + 1); }, 1000); }, []); // <- add empty brackets here return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>; } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Timer />); Run Example » Example: Here is an example of a useEffect Hook that is dependent on a variable."

    "document": "React useContext Hook React Context React Context is a way to manage state globally. It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone. useState useState The Problem State should be held by the highest parent component in the stack that requires access to the state. To illustrate, we have many nested components. The component at the top and bottom of the stack need access to the state. To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as \"props\" through each nested component. This is called \"prop drilling\". Example: Passing \"props\" through nested components: import { useState } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function Component1() { const [user, setUser] = useState(\"Jesse Hall\"); return ( <> <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1> <Component2 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component2({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 2</h1> <Component3 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component3({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 3</h1> <Component4 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component4({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 4</h1> <Component5 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component5({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 5</h1> <h2>{`Hello ${user} again!`}</h2> </> ); } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Component1 />); import { useState } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function Component1() { const [user, setUser] = useState(\"Jesse Hall\"); return ( <> <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1> <Component2 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component2({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 2</h1> <Component3 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component3({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 3</h1> <Component4 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component4({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 4</h1> <Component5 user={user} /> </> ); } function Component5({ user }) { return ( <> <h1>Component 5</h1> <h2>{`Hello ${user} again!`}</h2> </> ); } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Component1 />); Run Example » Even though components 2-4 did not need the state, they had to pass the state along so that it could reach component 5. The Solution The solution is to create context. Create Context To create context, you must Import createContext and initialize it: createContext import { useState, createContext } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; const UserContext = createContext() import { useState, createContext } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; const UserContext = createContext() Next we'll use the Context Provider to wrap the tree of components that need the state Context. Context Provider Wrap child components in the Context Provider and supply the state value. function Component1() { const [user, setUser] = useState(\"Jesse Hall\"); return ( <UserContext.Provider value={user}> <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1> <Component2 user={user} /> </UserContext.Provider> ); } function Component1() { const [user, setUser] = useState(\"Jesse Hall\"); return ( <UserContext.Provider value={user}> <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1> <Component2 user={user} /> </UserContext.Provider> ); } Now, all components in this tree will have access to the user Context.

Accessing DOM Elements In general, we want to let React handle all DOM manipulation. But there are some instances where useRef can be used without causing issues. useRef In React, we can add a ref attribute to an element to access it directly in the DOM. ref Example: Use useRef to focus the input: useRef import { useRef } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function App() { const inputElement = useRef(); const focusInput = () => { inputElement.current.focus(); }; return ( <> <input type=\"text\" ref={inputElement} /> <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button> </> ); } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<App />); import { useRef } from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; function App() { const inputElement = useRef(); const focusInput = () => { inputElement.current.focus(); }; return ( <> <input type=\"text\" ref={inputElement} /> <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button> </> ); } const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<App />); Run Example » Tracking State Changes The useRef Hook can also be used to keep track of previous state values. useRef This is because we are able to persist useRef values between renders."

Move the fetch logic to a new file to be used as a custom Hook: Example: useFetch.js: useFetch.js import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; const useFetch = (url) => { const [data, setData] = useState(null); useEffect(() => { fetch(url) .then((res) => res.json()) .then((data) => setData(data)); }, [url]); return [data]; }; export default useFetch; import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; const useFetch = (url) => { const [data, setData] = useState(null); useEffect(() => { fetch(url) .then((res) => res.json()) .then((data) => setData(data)); }, [url]); return [data]; }; export default useFetch; index.js: index.js import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; import useFetch from \"./useFetch\"; const Home = () => { const [data] = useFetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos\"); return ( <> {data && data.map((item) => { return <p key={item.id}>{item.title}</p>; })} </> ); }; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Home />); import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\"; import useFetch from \"./useFetch\"; const Home = () => { const [data] = useFetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos\"); return ( <> {data && data.map((item) => { return <p key={item.id}>{item.title}</p>; })} </> ); }; const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<Home />); Run Example » Example Explained We have created a new file called useFetch.js containing a function called useFetch which contains all of the logic needed to fetch our data. useFetch.js useFetch We removed the hard-coded URL and replaced it with a url variable that can be passed to the custom Hook. url Lastly, we are returning our data from our Hook. In index.js, we are importing our useFetch Hook and utilizing it like any other Hook. This is where we pass in the URL to fetch data from."

    "document": "Introduction to SQL SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. What is SQL? What Can SQL do? SQL is a Standard - BUT.... Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language. However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner. SELECT UPDATE DELETE INSERT WHERE Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard! Using SQL in Your Web Site To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need: RDBMS RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows. Look at the \"Customers\" table: Example Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table. A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table. A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table. Video: SQL Introduction"

Database Tables A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. \"Customers\" or \"Orders\"), and contain records (rows) with data. In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database (included in MS Access and MS SQL Server). Below is a selection from the Customers table used in the examples: The table above contains five records (one for each customer) and seven columns (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, and Country). Keep in Mind That... select SELECT In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case. Semicolon after SQL Statements? Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement. Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input. SQL in Web Pages SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database. Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString): SELECT Example The rest of this chapter describes the potential dangers of using user input in SQL statements. SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True Look at the example above again. The original purpose of the code was to create an SQL statement to select a user, with a given user id. If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering \"wrong\" input, the user can enter some \"smart\" input like this: UserId: Then, the SQL statement will look like this: The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the \"Users\" table, since OR 1=1 is always TRUE. Does the example above look dangerous? What if the \"Users\" table contains names and passwords? The SQL statement above is much the same as this: A hacker might get access to all the user names and passwords in a database, by simply inserting 105 OR 1=1 into the input field. SQL Injection Based on \"\"=\"\" is Always True Here is an example of a user login on a web site: Username: Password: Example Result A hacker might get access to user names and passwords in a database by simply inserting \" OR \"\"=\" into the user name or password text box: User Name: Password: The code at the server will create a valid SQL statement like this: Result The SQL above is valid and will return all rows from the \"Users\" table, since OR \"\"=\"\" is always TRUE. SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements Most databases support batched SQL statement. A batch of SQL statements is a group of two or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons. The SQL statement below will return all rows from the \"Users\" table, then delete the \"Suppliers\" table. Example Look at the following example: Example And the following input: User id: The valid SQL statement would look like this: Result Use SQL Parameters for Protection To protect a web site from SQL injection, you can use SQL parameters.

The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data. Note: Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name is the same, the size and other details may be different! Always check the documentation! MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0) In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time. String Data Types Numeric Data Types Note: All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column.
